"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop M1 Chip, 13&#34; Retina Display, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage, Backlit Keyboard, FaceTime HD Camera, Touch ID. Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray","Great battery life, great performance!","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022",5.0,"UPDATE 3/8/2023: i bought parallels desktop and a windows 11 license. I need it to try a certain amount of things in IT, however, the performance when running windows in a virtualized environment (like parallels is) it gets seriously affected on the M1, something that didn't happen with intel processors. You notice the performance degrading (but not that much, maybe 10, or even 15% i risk to say) when switching between full screens and main desktop with windows (full separate screen, remember that there's an option to seamlessly integrate within your macOS). You kinda feel the stutter but i can see the M1 processor get in the way and prioritize the screen, and that's a good thing to re-prioritize tasks that are being done in one screen or another (take the word ""screen"" as full-screen apps or software that switches between desktop and full-screen apps or between apps). In my case, running windows 11 makes the mbp m1 run hotter than i'm really use to, but it does not affect battery performance as much as i expected!... weird, isn't it?... love it!If you're going to virtualize something, that isn't Windows, you shouldn't worry that much on this laptop. Just remember that's still have 8gb ram and usable 228gb, therefore, performance wouldn't be the same as bare metal.Still, other regular software from apple or safari (or any other browser), Office365, Adobe XD, Photoshop do not affect performance nor consume that much battery, although if you are a graphic designer or a photographer making a quick change could make you brighten your screen, in which may lead to higher power consumption, which also could be confused by software running.One bad thing that i found with heavy usage is that the keyboard gets ""oily"", meaning, it wears in time and amount of usage per day; funny enough, the aluminum part of the palm rest don't have any signs of wear.Another thing that i found is that the left speaker sounds like it broke when hearing at 70% volume, i don't know if that's fixable or not, anywho anyhow... i'm gonna stick with that because i rarely use it.One thing that i've also found is how i got used to the fact that this mbp m1 takes nothing to return from suspended state, why? Because no matter what other laptop i use (or desktop, for that matter), all of them takes a few seconds to access to their respective desktops and another few seconds to actually be productive (after booting software)... This one literally takes nothing to wake and start using it... that's why i'm not changing this laptop... and yes, even with its flaws... why? because in critical cases when i need to go somewhere and fast react to do something at work, i just do it! it takes me 0 seconds to wake up the mbp and enter another desktop via anydesk or teamviewer or ssh... this takes time on most windows laptops... i love it!I just wish this laptop was upgradeable... after all at the end of the day, it makes my life so useful and convenient despite the down side of it... what a masterpiece! i just wish i could do more and more with it, i feel limited... but happy!and by the way, i still stand on my original review.ORIGINAL: I believe i've found my unicorn because this particular macbook air still lasts an insane amount of time! Although i don't use it on full brightness, i regulate it a lot. Connecting several devices to it via bluetooth is transparent, but unfortunately, Apple made the macOS more inconvenient to handle in terms of simplicity.User experience on the macOS is weird, you know as a mac user where things used to be, then you have to relearn some things and it doesn't feel like home, the new normal isn't good so far.Keyboard is relatively quiet, also, there's the missing keyboard light on this iteration of the macbook air, why did you take (probably) the most useful key from us?! if you're watching a movie you have to literally stop the movie, go through the menu from above and turn off the keyboard lights, or if you're on a presentation and everything is dark, you just turn your screen light down but you can't with your keyboard because you need to actually stop paying attention to the presentation and go through the menu, inconvenient as heck!I know (and i'm very well aware) that there are some workarounds to change to the keyboard light again using a small software... but that isn't the end-game, the thing is that we shouldn't need an extra software or aditional configuration just to use something the macbook had for, literally, over 10 years!Speed on this macbook: you don't even feel it... everything is instant, nothing is slow, if something is, it's most likely the software or the website you're on, is that simple! If you're planning on using massive storage, you should use an usb-c one, not an usb-a through usb-c dongle, you will have a bottleneck, that's guaranteed.I haven't used it on games because that's why i have my pc and xbox for. However, if you're planning on developing software on it, just make sure your libraries fit within 228gb (the half of it is recommended for all ssd's) of storage, if that's gonna be an issue, then go for usb-c massive storage.Weight isn't a problem, it makes you feel like you're having a premium laptop on your hands, but not enough to make your bag heavier. Construction feels like you own something premium and well-made."
"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop M1 Chip, 13&#34; Retina Display, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage, Backlit Keyboard, FaceTime HD Camera, Touch ID. Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray","Very lightweight, good speed, but NOT gold at all","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022",4.0,"Updated review with more detail [after 2 weeks]. ** See additional note re color.I switched to Mac 11 years ago, and for that entire period, I had the same laptop, a Macbook Pro, late-2011 model. After the initial adjustment, it has been a great laptop for all of these years. I used it for school, work, online browsing, a few applications, and streaming videos. I have never gamed on my 2011 laptop. Of course, it slowed down considerably after several years, and software and hardware updates can only help so much with an older model. So, I finally decided to purchase a new laptop, and based on my research on recent macbook models, the price and value was right on this 2020 Macbook Air.GENERAL FEATURES: Switching from a Pro to an Air model is weird at first because the Air is SO thin and lightweight. It has an extremely slim profile. I have to be extra careful when I grab the laptop to move to another room. Like other reviewers have said, the screen extends almost to the edge with minimal bezel, which also means very minimal border, so you are getting a ""larger"" screen. I did not mind the thick bezel black border on my pro and have been used to it for so long, but I took for granted that it actually provided a lot of protection for my screen. The macbook air has almost no bezel, which in my opinion, is not ideal. Let's hope it doesn't drop or get off balance because there is basically no protection for the screen. My older macbook pro has fallen a few times on it's corner or edge in 11 years and been fine, aside from minor cosmetic damage. But the larger edge and bezel came in really handy on the macbook pro when it lost balance and fell off the counter several years ago, but I quickly saved it by grabbing it by the screen and significantly reducing the impact when it landed [luckily not on hard floor]. Obviously not an ideal way to grab it, but it was a necessary save in that moment. The only damage was cracks through the top of my screen from the pressure of my palm, and some minor dent in the bottom of the laptop. Cosmetic damage, but thankfully did not effect the screen light, LCD, or anything else. I do not think the macbook air would survive this, especially how the screen is built.BATTERY: Upon opening the box, the battery life was already pretty high, and I decided not to charge it until the battery decreased to around 10-15%. I was still using my original macbook during the day for work, and the new macbook air during the evening for mostly online use and going through all of the system preferences and settings, and watching youtube in the background. Keeping that limited use in mind, I did not need to charge it for maybe 1 week. Great battery life thus far. I will likely be shifting to use this macbook air for work soon, in order to take advantage of the current OS, higher ram, and M1 chip, especially because I connect to virtual servers, which can take a toll on the ram and processor.SPEED/PORTS/BLUETOOTH: Compared to an older model pro, it has good speeds so far. I already knew that the number of ports have been reduced significantly, and that air has less ports than a pro anyway, so I purchased a thunderbolt adapter and a USB hub in advance to take care of that issue. So far, the thunderbolt adapter works fine to connect the macbook air to my Thunderbolt Display monitor. The bluetooth was able to connect to my ear buds, although pairing did take a bit longer than I expected. The bluetooth preferences do seem to be less detailed/less options than my previous macbook pro.CHARGER:  ** In my opinion, the previous magnetic chargers were superior to the current ones. They attached via magnet, the indicator light was red while charging, and green when fully charged. Easy and convenient. The mag-safe charger on this computer requires an additional push to be plugged in fully. This is just like most electronic devices, so it is not a bad feature, just requires an adjustment. It is probably safer for the computer and prevents it from easily coming unplugged. However, there is no indicator light, so you can't tell that it is plugged in and successfully charging unless you look at the battery status in the menu bar, and you also cannot see when it is finished charging just at a glance. You cannot confirm when the laptop is closed or on lock screen. You have to open the laptop, log in, and then check. Big bummer. **MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES: My previous macbook had a great feature: check the battery life at a glance with a quick push of a button while the laptop is still closed. After some additional research, I realized that apple removed the battery light indicator on the macbook pros many years ago, and that airs never had this feature. Big bummer. There is no way to check the battery life on this model without opening the laptop AND logging in, as the battery status in the menu bar on lock screen only shows the icon, but won't show you the percentage until you log in. Not ideal at all.-------Quick review for recently purchased product [during Black Friday]. I will update with a more detailed review once I have used it for a longer period.***** Important Note: If you are on the fence about purchasing the ""gold,"" don't get it. I had a silver MacBook Pro for many years, and I went back and forth for several days about the gold, especially after reading recent reviews and viewing customer images on multiple retailers that said the gold is closer to rose gold. I would disagree and say that the color is actually better described as dark blush pink or dark a reddish-mauve. Definitely not the look I wanted to have, and I regret not purchasing the staple silver, especially as I keep my electronics for many years beyond the 'normal time.' It would be a hassle and a lot of money to purchase the silver instead, since we cannot exchange in-store."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Great notebook with almost no weaknesses,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022",5.0,"Why is it that the PC world cannot make a good notebook for the same price? The MacBook Air is the bar that every PC model should be at. I bought a PC notebook that has seen more time at the repair depot than in my use. I finally decided to buy a MacBook Air because I was so impressed with a Mac mini I bought. I like everything about the Air from the keyboard, touchpad, beautiful screen quality and study chassis. I was skeptical of the finless design having had Intel MacBook Airs that ran very warm. So far this Apple silicon MacBook has stayed cool to touch. Honestly, I think a M1 MacBook is all many really need for general use cases. I highly recommend a MacBook Air over any PC notebook."

The battery lasts more than 10 hours, even when watching movies and TV shows.The only exception is when I edit 4k material for video in Davinci Resolve. There, the battery lasts for 3-4 hours. Just like in games. Although I don't play games on this laptop. I ran Froetnite once for a test, I liked it in principle and the FPS was stable 60+.Passive cooling makes this laptop silent. Which is just perfect for audio recording. In addition, it will never get clogged with dust.It's also very convenient that it can be charged via Type-C cable.

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Love Apple but this is disappointing...,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022",4.0,"I’m a big Apple fan. I usually use Macbook Pros for work. I decided to get the Air for the days when I don’t need the Pro with me. I like the size and the weight, but there are little glitches here and there that are just very annoying to me. Photos can’t crop more than two pictures at the time without glitches. I do the same on the Pro, no problem. This is easy work and has nothing to do with how ‘powerful’ your computer is. I’m talking about cropping regular phone size pics for social media. No filters or animations or anything like this. It can’t do that.Sometimes when you try to write a post on social media, the space bar moves cursor up as an arrow, rather than a space, usually when you get to the second paragraph of your post. I haven’t noticed this in Pages, just social media. These are small things but when you’re in a hurry, they can be very annoying. The button to change languages is very temperamental, sometimes works, sometimes doesn’t. If you’re trying to write a social media post in two different languages, good luck. You have to select outside of the post pop-up in order to change your language every single time. And IDK, it might be just mine that is doing this, but it’s making me stay away from everything Air.As far as Amazon shipment, delivery and so on, no complains. Everything was as expected for this item."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Awesome notebook computer!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022",5.0,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!"

I needed better accessibility features than Windows could provide. The chance was easier than I anticipated and I've found no reason to use Windows emulators. In the past, I've enjoyed the convenience of having a laptop. But I just couldn't see them well enough anymore. So I took a leap of faith spurred on by a great Amazon Deal at $799.Setup was very easy.. it just cloned everything on my iMac that I wanted to transfer over.  The screen is bright and easy to see even for me. The keyboard feels good and the trackpad works well. There's a fingerprint ID to unlock it... very convenient.This is the M1 MacBook Air. I purchased it shortly after the M2 MacBook Air came out. It was 18 months old but that's what provided the exceptional price. The M2 based MacBook would be faster and offered MagSafe charging, and a brighter display. There were also several handy ports lacking on the M1 model. But the M2 has an overheating problem that the M1 doesn't. I didn't think these features were work several hundred more dollars.This M1 MacBook is fast enough and has reasonably good battery life. But there are a few drawbacks that I was aware of before I made the purchase:The only ports are a headphone jack and two Thunderbolt connectors. To solve this issue, I bought a small dock.You're buying the base model with a 128g solid state drive. This is less than ideal but there are workarounds. First, you can purchase an inexpensive drive (solid state if possible) and offload some things to that drive. Another option is to upgrade your iCloud storage to 50gb for .99 cents a month.Is this a good deal? The answer is YES!"

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Outstanding,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2023",5.0,"I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage).  I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly).  Although I've been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO.  Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.The M1 processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously.  Battery life is every bit as good as advertised; I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in.  Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that's to be expected.  I love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool.  In use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for Apple processors (as MacOS Big Sur is).  Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization; the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine.  I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it's my current default browser.  The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome addition.The only cons I see are minor in my opinion.  Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you'll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store.  There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair.  For me that's not insurmountable; I simply use a USB-C hub to provide additional connectivity.  I've read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs.  To be on the safe side I use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.Reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding.  For example, I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine ""has NO USB PORTS!!!"", which is patently false.  In fact, its two ports are both USB, they just require a different connector.  What these users are looking for is the old USB-A connectors, which this MacBook does not have; however, that's easily fixed by using a USB-A to USB-C converter cable, or with a USB-C hub.  USB-A peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.All things considered, I really love this machine.  The $899 price (at the time I bought mine) was $100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store, and I believe I can probably get $200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air (try that with a 7-year-old PC!) leaving me with a total outlay of $699.  Considering that I'll almost certainly get 5 or more years use out of this model, I'm very happy with my purchase and would do it again."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",It's a MacBook,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2023",5.0,"I'm no tech expert. The last laptop I owned was a 2015 MacBook Pro (13-inch), which I used daily until the battery became too weak to hold a charge for more than a couple of hours. That's normal after you've gone through the standard 1000 recharge cycles and seven years of use. It served me well.I pretty much only use this thing to write Amazon reviews and so far it's doing the job well. I will say the Air is the lowest model of the MacBooks and I bought the 2020 M1 model rather than the newest one available for 2022. Going from a 2015 Pro, I noticed this machine is noticeably stronger in performance. It's also lighter and quieter because it has no cooling fans (doesn't really heat up so it doesn't need them).My only real complaint I'll say at this point is the lack of ports. You get two USB-C ports and a regular headphone jack. I'm glad they at least decided to keep the headphone jack. So you'll most likely need to buy a dongle or some adapter to expand your ports which then makes the laptop clunky and less portable.I'll finish with this - if you don't know the pros and cons of buying an Apple vs non-Apple (usually Windows-based) laptop, definitely look that up. There are basics you should know like Apple is not gaming-friendly and installing software in their OS vs Windows is quite different."

My intent for using this one was for a consulting business I am a part of doing teaching presentations, etc. I wanted something that was small and traveled easy but also durable. Using this was a pleasure from the keyboard to the color and clarity of the screen. It feels good in the hand and seems like a very premium and quality product  I use this laptop for a job one day recently and literally at full brightness for around 8 1/2 hours on its battery. What I found is I liked it so much that I added more applications to make this my daily laptop but the standard 8 GB it came with just wasn’t enough. I was getting RAM full warnings at least once or twice a day. I have since given this laptop to my wife who had a 2011 Air and have purchased a new 16 GB M2 version for myself. As nice and robust, and as good looking as this laptop, is I highly recommend it but if you think for a moment that you might need extra ram, go ahead and bump up to the next level. in my opinion, this is the best $1000 laptop on the market with the best battery life and quality overall."

 I’ve really been wanting a laptop and I use apple products. I’ve heard great things about MacBooks in the past.  I enjoy it for writing college papers, internet searches, iMessage while I’m using it and not my phone is helpful for receiving messages, emailing for school and work. It doesn’t have a lot of games that download from my iPhone 13, but that would be my only complaint. Pretty sure Apple moved away from downloading each app separately like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and has one app called ‘finder’ . I would recommend to a friend this MacBook Air."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Love this notebook!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2023",5.0,"I recently migrated to Apple after many years using a wide variety of PCs running Windows or Linux. I decided to make that move after Apple's introduction of the M1 processor, which has been proven to be an excellent hardware platform. Now. of course, the M2 has been released, but, depending on your needs, the 2020 Macbook Air with the M1 will save you some money while still delivering outstanding performance and some of the most attractively and perfectly manufactured hardware. You can search the Internet for professional reviews of the Macbook Air, but I feel confident you'll find plenty to verify what I'm saying.The Retina display is beautiful. The sound system is superior to any other laptop I have owned or used. The battery holds up all day under typical use, and I can verify that the battery holds its charge well for at least a week while the notebook is powered off. The Apple OS (Monterey) is smooth and fast, and I was able to learn my way around in it quickly. When you need help, a Google search will yield tons of tips quickly, or you can avail yourself of Apple support.I will say that the Air is a little short on USB ports, lacks a built-in card slot, and, of course, is not equipped with a touchscreen. However, I have run a USB hub from one of the two Thunderbolt ports, and there seems to be enough power to support my flash drives and card readers...even a portable DVD-burner. As far as a touchscreen goes, I have that on a Dell laptop I run Linux on, but I never use it...guess I'm a mouse or touchpad guy.The aluminum housing is beautifully machined and finished, the keyboard has a very nice touch, the battery seems to charge quickly, and the Air is light at under 3 lbs.One last thing! I have been a heavy user of both Google and Microsoft services, and I have found that Apple provides ample support for integrating those services into the Mac environment. I run Google's Backup and Sync and Microsoft's OneDrive with no problems. My AVG subscription allows me to use my antivirus software on both Mac OS and Windows machines.I have no regrets for this purchase. Actually, the Air was my 3rd M1 Mac. I also have an iMac and a Mac Mini. They all work together very well!"

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Over to the Darkside,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 9, 2023",5.0,"Update:I saw some reviews that said their 3rd party usb hub broke their Mac. I've been using a usb-c to usb-a for a few weeks now with no problems (made by UNI). It's worked for everything I threw at it; Logitech G910 keyboard, Razor mouse, Yamaha digital piano, RME Audio Interface, Roland A-49 midi keyboard. They all worked. I also have a cheapo Amazon Basics single usb adaptor cord about 6"" long, and it too works with everything on the MacBook.After decades of looking through Bill Gates' Windows, I bought my first Mac but only because of the new M1 chip, where everything is on this one chip, which makes it faster. Applications optimized for the M1 now rival high end PCs (and for the first time too). I never was interested in Macs because they were overpriced and underpowered, but it looks like that worm has turned. Just don't buy an earlier version of Macs, especially with Intel chips.Keep in mind when/if you buy this, there are NO upgrades later on; ZERO, NADA, nothing to change out. You can't add RAM nor Storage once it's built. (There is a workaround on storage, by adding an external SSD drive, but as I understand it there are some problems viewing what is on your external drive, but that may change over time.)Also, SSD storage, while blazingly fast and so worth it, need about 10% 'headroom.' That is for example, if you have 256GB storage, you can only use 230GB as you need a 10% reserve to account for SSDs getting used up. It's the nature of the beast. And of course the preinstalled software also takes up storage space from day one. For my PC I bought a 250GB SSD and found that it was maxing out pretty fast, so I replaced with a 1TB SSD and have already filled up half of it, but I don't expect to fill it up completely anytime soon. It should be good for maybe a decade or so.So bottom line, get at least the 512GB storage or you'll be sorry. It does kind of suck that Apple charges so much for each step increase in storage, but paying the extra $200 in this case is worth it, IMHO. The jury is still out on if you need 16BG of RAM vs the 8GB models currently in stock, (Apple treats it like a custom order at this time, with a waiting period.)  If it was a PC, then getting 16GB RAM is a no-brainer, but in the case of the M1 chip, it shares memory within the chip, making the most use of it. I have 32GB in my PC because RAM sticks are relatively cheap.Remember, once you buy a MacBook, it will stay as is. Upgrades are impossible (which has always been the case for notebooks anyway)."

But a warning:  when Apple says it's easy to migrate data from your old Mac to a new Mac over your residential wifi, don't believe them!  To do it in a reasonable amount of time, you'll need to buy a Thunderbolt 4 and a type c connector dongle, so be prepared in advance.  There's no ethernet port in this model and using residential wifi to migrate data is an exercise in frustration (would take 30+ hours).  Other than that, I've had no significant issues so far.

I decided to try a mac to learn something new. After research i decided to get the mac air m1 w 8GB ram and the 512GB SSD - this is what i learned ( not going into why i decided what i did as anyone can do the same research1. setup and initial use was not as easy as advertised- couldnt get past the country selection and found after search many had same problem. almost returned it but i finally found i could move selection by tab key AND selection based on space press and  NOT return key - track pad was useless - ( it had a little to do with track pad setup that can only be performed later as well as track pad difference from MS product) .windows and track pad usage not same as windows and i couldn't resize screen windows or even drag them on the screen -plenty of tutorials on you tube - but none really helped decipher selection until i figured it out watching an excel tutorial on how to select and drag cells - you have to ""hard"" press.This hard press finally solved the moving and resizing windows issues - again none of this info was included with product.2. very confusing from reviews n QnAs whether or not this mac had 7 or 8 core GPU - according to internal report its 8 core3. what have i learned -- very lightweight machine- lots of internal tweaking can be done to personalize machine- very fast on the task used - browsing and some excel files now needing to run under mac for which i purchased new software- beautiful screen- great battery life- particularly liked my iphone messages show up on the mac and i can send and receive on same - apple makes computer look sim to phone4. recommendation - for 1000$ to 1200$ a student or any one like me, whos not going to program or have a gazillion windows open or need a large screen, can get this machine - a comparable windows machine would cost same but a windows machine can also be purchased for a lot less and still be capable of student tasks.However, the battery life and weight and integration w iphone tip the scales to this machine if you want to purchase a comparable MS product"

I've been using the windows subsystem for Linux and other Unix based shells for work for a long time and I've always had the desire to try development on a Mac.I assumed that it would be like any other Windows machine that's had the OS replaced with Linux, one of my favorite computers was a Lenovo with Ubuntu on it so that's what I expected.I bought a Surface Pro X which has an ARM based processor (ms sq1 chip) so I thought that I knew what to expect, I assumed that it would be frustrating that the majority of the software I used probably wouldn't work correctly but I have to say that Apple did so much better than Microsoft on this one. The M1 chip makes this $1,000 laptop feel like a $2500 laptop. I've only run into one application that couldn't run and the general online community recommended an alternative for me.the most difficult thing for me was getting used to the different keyboard layout but once I did, this laptop has been nothing short of a pleasure to work with and has replaced my Surface laptop 3 as my daily driver and primary software development machine.I might revert to my Surface laptop three if I go back to .NET development in the future but for the general web stuff I typically do, I couldn't ask for a better machine.The battery life is excellent, this laptop feels premium, I have no doubt that this will last me well into the future and it has completely changed my mind about Apple.The biggest downside in my opinion is that I spent a fortune on accessories and peripherals because Apple products tends to exist in their own separate ecosystem which can be a bit frustrating.One thing that everyone should be aware of is that you can't connect this laptop to two separate external displays. I had to get used to One external display and then using a virtual desktop. That is unfortunate because I really liked having three monitors at all times but I haven't found a way to make it work with this machine.Generally speaking, I would recommend this to anybody who's considering it. Unless you are a PC gamer, there's very little that this computer won't excel at. I'd argue that it might be the best quality laptop in this price range by a factor of two, and I have historically been very critical of Apple."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",MUST HAVE FOR ANY STUDENT.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2021",5.0,"I have had the M1 MacBook Air 13-inch now since December 2020. It has served me so well and has been one of the most reliable laptops I've ever owned. I am originally a PC guy and now work back and forth between Windows OS and Mac OS.When it comes to rendering videos and clips, this does a way better job at 4K resolution compared to my former Alienware 17 inch laptop AND my workplace's gaming desktop!I am pretty happy with the battery life so far. I have been getting 10+ hours of hard real-world usage. I bring a nice USB-C portable battery with me to charge it when I am doing work on the weekends out of town or while on the plane. This thing has not failed me once.8GB of RAM is more than enough for the majority of consumers and is enough for me even though I edit photos and videos all the time. I have not seen any ""throttling"" from the M1 MacBook Air since ownership. I can even open up 30+ tabs on Chrome without issue.256GB storage is enough as long as you have an external storage. I highly recommend investing in getting an SSD or NVMe external storage so transfer speeds are optimal. Otherwise, as long as you are keeping the core hard drive tidy, you won't run into any storage issues.Virtual classes are nice. The webcam quality is crystal clear, and it is noticeably better than most of my peers.My only complaint is that the design is a bit ""outdated"" despite how premium and beautiful it is.Just FYI. I just bought two of these; one for myself and one for my friend who just had a massive upgrade from her ""prehistoric"" 2010 iMac. She was absolutely mindblown by how much faster and better it is compared to the older iMac.Overall, this is a very nice all-around computer laptop for ANY student from K all the way up to the graduate level. Go get this beast of a machine now for $850."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Very happy,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2023",5.0,"I love this laptop. It replaced an Acer aspire 5 slim, which was quite heavy, and had a battery that lasted five hours. In power saver mode. It was only two years old and rarely used until I started a new job and school. I had my MacBook going from 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM pretty much consistently, and it still had 55% battery life. Because I have an iPhone, I can make calls and send texts with it. My iPad can be used for sidecar, which is basically wireless screen mirroring, allowing me to have a portable second monitor. The mac doesn’t skip a beat- I can leave it closed overnight, and everything is exactly the same the next morning without crashing or reloading. It’s not at all heavy, and the size is exactly what a laptop should be. The Mac OS not supporting steam titles thing isn’t a huge deal- If I want a gaming machine, I have a desktop. For getting things done, this is an absolutely perfect daily driver, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone. My one gripe is lack of USB-A ports, but I’ll buy an adapter and move on with my life. Overall, try a MacBook Air… You’ll like it. UPDATE: I found a program called Parsec and so long as my Mac has a stable WiFi connection, I can remote into my desktop and use steam along with everything else."

Sadly, no matter what I did I could not get past the migration screen. Finally deciding to go through the migrating data from my pc to my new mac, it didn't work. Now, as you can guess, I'm not a mac user but the whole process was more than I could deal with so I decided to return the macbook to Amazon. It's been weeks since UPS dropped it off and I'm still waiting for a credit and, yes, I had contacted Amazon before returning the mac. So, all I can say is, unless you know how to use a mac, don't waste your time. It's not user friendly or easy to use and if you return it, you'll have to wait weeks to get a refund."

I also live in an apartment complex and have a special kiosk system for packages. It's nice when I am out of town which I was when the package came. It came earlier than expected. I don't usually use the kiosk but they left it in there for me all securely. Laptop works great. The gift was a success as well! The only thing is that the camera could be better. My boyfriend needed a laptop due to his Lenovo shutting down and a nice camera (his old one stopped working) to confirm his identity for online tests. He tested it out and it was pretty blurry for a pricey laptop which is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5.

I have owned several windows gaming laptops and this is hands down the best laptop I have ever purchased. The build quality is amazing, the chassis, hinge, keyboard, and mousepad all feel very high quality. the laptop is light and easy to carry around. The battery lasts what feels like a lifetime. The computer does not get hot at all (even after some heavy video editing and transcoding). Apple has truly made the best laptop on the market. Now to the negatives: I have read that the OS excessively uses virtual memory to speed up the system. After doing some initial tests I can confirm that this is true. What does this mean? this means that the Internal SSD might not last as long as it should because of the excessive write and read to the Solid state drive. I don't know I this is by design or what but it definitely feels kinda crummy for Apple to do this. I would still recommend this computer to anyone needing a laptop for school, creative work, or just general use. Buy it you won't regret it."

La nueva iMac no me agrada su diseño, así que también por presupuesto adquirí esta MacBook Air M1 a muy buen precio, es muy ligera lo cual hace que pueda transportarla fácilmente. Es realmente rápida comparada con mi antigua Mac y con la compu del trabajo.El principal uso que le doy es ofimática, algo de diseño de fotos y videos, navegar en internet, Spotify, YouTube, correos, Netflix y así.Cuando la configuré al inicio, se calentó bastante sin aparentemente estar haciendo nada y me preocupé pero leí que es normal al configurar la laptop por primera vez, después que ya quedó lista, ocupó de varias horas eso sí, no ha vuelto a molestar con altas temperaturas.Ahora bien, no es que le he dado un uso intensivo así que no podría decir si en realidad se calienta mucho al llevarla a un uso extremo. Como aun no es mi computadora principal, no la uso mucho a diario, por lo que me ha durado la batería, después de cargarla al 100 %, casi una semana llegando al 15 % al quinto día sin apagarla de un día para el otro, solo la cierro y la uso al día siguiente; hago esto porque he leído que así funciona mejor Mac OS.En unos meses pienso realizar una actualización de esta opinión de usuario.Ahhhhh!!!, de ley consigan un USB-C hub, yo compré uno con 3 USB-A y una entrada para ethernet."

It's actually the second M1 Air in our family (I bought a refurbished one earlier this year to replace a retiring 2012 Air), and at $799 for the 8 GB RAM / 256 GB SSD model is an insanely great value.Some of the other recent reviews mentioned a musty odor and speculated these had been in storage or previously used. There was a slight musty or chemical odor when the box was opened, but upon checking carefully I found the smell originated from the included printed materials, NOT the computer itself or the packaging. There was absolutely no sign of mold, moisture, or dampness in the box, the sealed packaging, or the laptop.Installing and running a utility showed this Air was assembled in August 2022 and had so far logged no battery cycles. It's a new M1 Air, not old stock. (The 2020 date in the description is the year the M1 Air model was introduced, not when this computer was made.)"

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Back to Apple,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 30, 2022",5.0,"Not long ago I decided to get far from Apple products because some work necessities I couldn't cover with an iPhone and a Mac. The limitation of the Iphone for some advanced features (like dual SIM and the possibility to flash OS images from a ssd) and the need to use bootcamp in the Mac made me jump to an android phone and a windows computer.I had a Samsung s10+ and a Huawei Matebook pro with windows and linux. Both devices are impeccable. Really made my work easier in so many aspects. But as time passed my life wasn't getting simpler like it was with my Iphone and my Mac.Apple products work flawlessly between each other and there are always new implementations that simplifies everyday life. Quality of this products and its software is incredible. Although other products have better capabilities ( for example my Matebook outperforms this MacBook Air m1 and has a much better quality screen) they lack the simplicity and stability.Being all this said, The MacBook Air M1 is a really great laptop. The most basic version which is the one I bought is blazing fast, stable and with a great battery life (much better than the Huawei Matebook pro). Also its absolute silent and fresh. Its doesn't get hot at all.To make my work easier I had to pay for some software that saddly I was denied to pay on the Mac at the beginning.  Apple products are expensive but I've learned that in the long run they are worth it. Life is about time and how you spend it and apple definitely focus its effort to simplify the time you use to do a task.I wanted to share my story in case you are in a situation like I had. If you have an iPhone and other Apple products don't doubt. Buy a Macbook Air M1. I still have a beefy windows machine for gaming, rendering, and other things. But most of the time I rather work in my new MacBook."

I am NOT a techie person so don't expect fancy tech terms or a deep understanding of all things Apple in this review.  I'm your standard user looking for a dedicated, decent machine for work without breaking the bank.The M1 chip is supposed to be crazy fast compared to the previous version and yes, so far it is pretty good.  I use a graphic webpage called Canva and I am constantly getting a message telling me that it's using excessive power & slowing my Macs performance down.  This even happens with Candy Crush..  I haven't noticed any decrease in performance though.I also have the 2018 MacBook Air and it's FaceTime video is FAR superior to this 2020 version which is very low quality and grainy.. I think my 2014 HP has a better quality video.  So if you're looking for clear, crisp video for Zoom meetings you won't find it here.  I mean really, I expected a LOT more from an Apple product.The power cord is not magnetic like the 2018, which to me was a much better design.  ""Someone"" is forever tripping over my cord and yanking it out which was fine with the 2018 version but this one will end up damaged if I can't find a way to get it out of the way.  Small spaces are challenging :)I had to buy a compatible hub so that I could continue using my USB wireless mouse & flash drives since this MacBook Air only has 2 ""thunderbolt usb"" ports & one of them is for the power cord.  It's not backwards compatible with all of my standard USB devices and no place at all for an SD card.I do LOVE the convenience fingerprint login/keychain feature.  I love that it's very quiet (so far) and other than FaceTime the colors and screen resolution are excellent and vibrant as advertised."

If you want a second or third monitor setup, get any ""display-link"" certified hub like the Dell 452-BCYT D6000 Universal Dock (pricey) or the WAVLINK USB 3.0 Universal Laptop Docking Station,USB C to 5K/ Dual 4K @60Hz Video (cheaper).The 7 cores of GPU on this model won't be noticed vs 8 cores. The machine is a beast. I'm using Lumafusion to process video (not even designed for MacOS but ports across from iPadOS) and it's 3X as fast as the iPad Pro that I own - 2019Best laptop I've ever owned and I've owned two earlier MacBook pro's, a Mac mini, several windows laptops, and the Dell S2721Q 27 Inch 4K UHD monitor I purchased here is parked on top of the last windows machine I purchased.The 4K dell monitor is easily crisp enough for MacOS and I purchased the keyboard used and Magic Mouse (2) new, on Amazon.It's been a while since I've been on MacOS and would describe it as wonderful to use and look at, after coming from windows 10. Sidecar is also amazing (using the iPad Pro to the right for that)If you're shopping for a laptop or a Mac laptop, this is a good option.You'll love it. Nuff said."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Best entry into a Mac,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 25, 2023",5.0,"I have always wanted a MacBook, ever since I was a little kid. But, there was always something that stopped me from getting one. They always mentioned that the Air wasn't very good, from 2011 all the way up to 2019, reviews always mentioned the multiple flaws MacBook Air had; from the thermal throttling, to the super small SSD (128 at base price), over $1000, then the Butterfly Keyboard etc. The list went on and on, and I really thought that it wasn't worth the money. Until, WWDC 2020, Apple announced they would start making their own chips straight from home, I was so excited for this new generation, it reminded me of the time when they went from PowerPC to Intel. The excitement was there, and I loved the new unibody that started in 2016, with the removal of unnecessary ports for the average Joe. Everything was the same, but the new M1 chip. That is when I realized that this M1 MacBook Air was the one for me. I didn't hesitate and started saving until I had enough to buy it. And, I absolutely made the best decision in purchasing it. It is amazing, it's super slim. portable, super fast processing speed and power. The screen is beautiful, the bezels are unnoticeable. The keyboard is outstanding, To be completely honest, this laptop makes you want to be more productive, just because of its speed and its ease of use. If you're thinking about purchasing a Mac, this by far is one of the better choices (and the cheapest nonetheless) The charger is also outstanding! 30w is all you need for this little thing."

After a couple of weeks, it had a big OS update: Big Sur to Monterey. The problems started happening - I kept getting locked out, passwords not working, account name not working - resulting to my having to run to the Mac Service Center 2x.The first time they said the update caused some issues. Second one said, it was a file vault issue.Also, noticed how since the update my battery life has decreased. The tech guys said this is normal after an update due to the machine still settling and should stabilize soon. It's been a couple of weeks and still the same. I've even heeded the advice of not logging out nor shutting down, just folding the laptop, to let the machine keep working on the kinks. Also because it's an M1 technology so no need to formally shut it down like a PC.Not sure of what's really going on, tbh.Perhaps it is due to Apples newest OS being buggy, or it could be the unit is a lemon. Not sure. But giving it one last chance and if it fails me again before the 90 day warranty is up, I am returning it."

When I was looking for a laptop to buy, I almost went with a used, older MacBook Air. I decided to just spend the extra money and get a brand new computer and the newest model and I’m so happy I did because Apple’s M1 chip is impressive. After two months of owning this laptop, I think my favorite thing is the battery life. For lighter tasks (web browsing, listening to music, steaming Netflix etc), the battery could last the entire day, and I love how I can take this thing anywhere with me without having to lug a charger around as well. For heavier tasks, it of course doesn’t last all day but you get a lot of hours out of the battery. It rarely gets hot, and doesn’t even have a fan, so you know how efficient that chip is running. I also love the fanless design because I can have it with me in my bed or anywhere and not worry about blocking vents or getting dog hair in those fans. I don’t use it for anything crazy, mainly just work and personal stuff, along with frequent streaming and occasionally I’ll fire up the Sims 4 (and it runs beautifully by the way). But I’m never not impressed by how quick it is, opens applications almost instantly and wakes instantly. Also, I am new to Mac with this purchase but have owned iPhones for a decade and I love the seamless integration jumping between applications on your laptop and phone. So far I’m loving Big Sur and basically this is just a laptop that would be great for almost anyone."

It's brand new except the warranty has only a few months left. Can't complain at all! This computer is awesome as I upgraded from 2013 Macbook Pro Retina. It's way faster. But 8GB of ram will be slow at times, and the laptop gets hot during summer months. Also the trackpad has a tendency of dragging instead of clicking when you're clicking around really fast. Like when you're trying to get that hot concert ticket, and you click really fast on Ticketmaster, it drags the text or link instead of clicking on it like it should which causes a second of two of delay. I hope they get this fixed but it's unlikely they will ever notice this. Most people don't use trackpad to click as fast as me."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Workhorse,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2022",5.0,So for the most part I use this for when I am traveling or out and about for my business. I find it the right size for the job I am doing and take advantage of Apples cloud storage and ways of using other Mac's as storage for information so this doesn't use storage much at all. Where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road. Most of the time I am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new Mac Mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information. I find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work. When connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iPhone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work. If you are debating getting one for business I recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop. Also the battery for most of the work I am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload 4 days max. Honestly you can't get too much better for a long lasting Apple hardware focused product.

Took out of the brown apple box, then took wrapping off of the white box. Slowly let it open like the awesome packaging does.. then boom! Smells like mold/mildew… Tried thinking it was the box, closed it up, with computer and charger out. Computer fired right up, the power cord seems to be the smelly part. When I unwrapped it it left a sticky residue only my hands and the room just smells of moldy mildew. Not the apple experience I expected…"

The MBA is an amazing little tool for the form factor that it is.  It is a quick little machine with ZERO noise.  Can you believe that?  Stick with me and I will try and keep it simple enough.  Processing power is ""decent"".  It does not wow me, especially with graphics intensive workflows like Lightroom, Photoshop and Panoramic building.  Everything else it works just as intended and no real hiccups.  Being that my business is in the creative realm I import a TON of data via USB and the macbook air's inputs.  I must say I am completely up in arms with the inputs in this decive and would imagine the inputs in the Macbook Pro would operate in the same fashion.For instance it took almost 1 hour to input a 64gb SD card.

Unboxing this is a delight, it's just a beautiful machine. You can start working with it as soon as the initial setup is done, which might take a few minutes. Love the display, bright colors, nice resolution, everything looks crisp. Keys are a delight to type with, real smooth. Battery life is the best I've ever witnessed, I just recharge this thing every other day, whereas my previous laptop would use three rounds of charge a day (and I had for just one year).What I disliked: some of my favorite apps are still not ready for Apple Silicon or M1 chip. It's given me two or three random reboots with cryptic error logs already. And coming from over 25 years using mostly Windows (and some 2-3 years using Linux) I feel like I have to rewire my brain to start using the fn, control, option & command keys properly.All in all, it's a really solid laptop although I feel like I still haven't made the most out of it. No heavy usage so far, except for some minor audio production work. Guess I'll do it eventually. Hope app compatibility gets better with time too, that's the reason for the missing star up there, otherwise, it would've been 5-stars all the way."

I love the OS BIG SUR and now can't wait to the next OS.  I only got 256gb cuz I didn't know if I would like this plus I knew i had to learn the OS.  Now, I'm waiting for the M2 Mac Book Pro, i plan to invest a lot more money into that one now I know that I like the Apple OS.  Looking at getting 2tb 32gigs of ram!  I like that it runs the apps from iOS or iPadOS!  I wish the screen was better though.  I'm talking at least mini-led but would prefer OLED for what I use it for.  Battery life is amazing!

Macs have never been a good value. I wanted a $1000 laptop, and my choices quickly narrowed to this. It has the best laptop processor and the best screen money can buy, especially at this price. The battery life on MacBooks is always good, so I knew that wouldn't be an issue.After purchase, I've come to the same conclusions. The screen is wonderful. Bright and high res, excellent color accuracy. The M1 processor speed has blown me away with its performance. I don't need much RAM or Storage, so I'm still happy with that. I do wish for more RAM, but I don't necessarily need it for my work I do. What has blown my mind more than anything else is the battery life. I've never had a laptop like this. I don't have to carry a charger with me anymore: the MacBook easily handles a full day of charge. I also like the fact that it doesn't have a fan. I don't have to worry about thermals when getting comfy in my bed and doing some light work.Overall, best laptop I've ever purchased. I've had no issues over more than a month of ownership, and I'm super picky about tech as well as slightly anti-Apple, so I've basically converted because of this machine."

Now, there have been some anomalies with different apps and things.  No show stoppers.  But you can clearly tell which apps were updated for the M1 and which weren't  They work fine, but take a several seconds to open.One process I use it for is livestreaming our church services using OBS, and iPhone and a USB Audio device for the feed from the mixer.  All of this is streamed only to FB Live and recorded on machine.  On the MBP, this all worked fine, but the battery couldn't keep up, even plugged in.  Had the same issue on my 2018 MBP 13"".  But the M1 does all of this without any issues from a power perspective.  Plus, it's much more stable for this use than the MBP.  I would get a lot of sticking video on the MBP and have, so far, received none on the M1.Very happy with the price too.  But, get as much memory and disk space as you can afford.

Last had a MacBook Pro 13” in about 2015 when we had real ports. I realize those days aren’t coming back and it’s #HubLife or #NoLife. But I’ve been underwhelmed with Apples offerings for a minute.When I started reading up and watching vids on the new M1 I was sold. I’m all in now. This Air is an absolute unit of a machine. I really see no reason for anyone to get the Pro, unless you’re getting the soon to be released updated 16” pro. This bad boy will do all that most people need.Let me say first off, the battery life is phenomenal. I can take it on the go and use it all day with no issues at all. I didn’t even pack my charger with me today. I can carry it in a simple sleeve and I’m good to go. Plus it’s lighter than the pro as well.Performance is spectacular. It runs circles around anything else I have that’s windows based. In testing, I’ve seen it surpass or hold its own, against prior MacBook Pro models. Even those with dedicated graphics.For the majority of people, this is going to be their go to laptop. What you get for an entry level Mac is stellar. This is my recommendation for anyone outside of a hardcore video/photo editor. But even then, in a pinch it will get the job done."

It was never dropped or in anyway handled roughly and sat in the same place on my table. Yesterday it developed horizontal lines throughout the display.  When I called customer service they were very helpful and set up an appointment with the repair desk on 14 th street in Manhattan. The guy there took a look and said that the MacBook was “damaged” that the display was cracked under the glass, and the repair would cost $500.When I explained that NOTHING had happened to the computer but the Apple guy first suggested that my dog did it. He then said it could have been caused by closing it on a cord.  That is at least theoretically possible though I in fact did not close a cord in there. The damage he pointed to was not anywhere near the hinge where a cord might cause pressure, but at the top of the screen where closing would cause the least pressure if a cord were in the way.  All I know is that one morning the display was screwed up.  Later,  when I wiped the screen with a piece of cloth to try and photograph the 1/2 inch crack, it extended down screen and the display went black.If the computer can be damaged by being closed, it violates New York’s implied warranty of merchantability, matter how much Apple tries to avoid standing behind its incredibly crappy product.I would be interested in forming a class action based on the fact that this flimsy product does not perform the functions of a laptop computer."

I needed to clarify this camera issue for those holding back from purchasing such a great computer just due to those negative camera opinions, as I was.

So far...I have to say the speed of the new M1 processor compared to any of the Windows 10 computers is very impressive and just the speed and ""faster response"" the MacBook seems to have combined with the programs I have downloaded and a few I purchased I would have to say I prefer the MacBook.  I added a 7 port USB hub and a trackball I use instead of the built in pad but other then that I have not changed a thing.  It definitely does everything I need it to do both business related an for pleasure.  I also enjoy the small portable size and will be taking it on it's first trip in just a few days.

Her old 2012 Macbook Pro could finally be put to rest.These machines last a LONG time. The battery life easily lasts her two full days of use (probably around 15 hours).As a nurse, she’s constantly looking up new techniques or reviewing current literature, so her next laptop needed to be power-efficient, but powerful.The M1 does just that.The screen quality is second to none as you can expect from Apple products.This particular mac (2020 MacBook Air M113”) does NOT have the touchbar that thePros do — and we’re glad! It felt out of place when we were trying out the new lineup of Macs.This Air also has the “new” keyboard— which is just Apple going back to their old style of chiclet keyboard—a fan favorite.Also, this Air never gets hot. This is something new to me as I’m used to devices running too hot after long usage, but the Air’s M1 is so efficient the laptop doesn’t need a fan!"

It has the new M1 chip and it is fast. For the type of things I do in a home office this is lightning fast. I don't do a lot of editing of videos or play video games on it so my work load is pretty mundane compared to others. I like it though because it is lightweight when I take it to my den or on a trip in my computer bag. The battery lasts a long time and the keyboard is very responsive. Love the screen clarity. I have not found any of my regular apps having any difficulty running on the new chip. I did set up a new camera connection app to see how it would do and had no issues either. It is running in the background and when they update to work specifically with the new chip it should work even better. I don't have any negatives with this computer. I have been an Apple fan for several years now and so use to it that I have great difficulty when trying to use a Window's based computer.

Flicker with 4K,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2020",2.0,"Buying into the Apple ecosystem should only be done to make products for the ecosystem which will make the user money, but, do not make them a critical part of your workflow.  They are too expensive for that.  Apple just does not make good computers.  Yes, they make a OK operating system, but they make computers that cannot be repaired by taking out the ssd or ram sticks and putting new ones in.You can't just go and buy the parts to fix your Mac computers when they break.  The MacBook Air is no exception to this.  The SSD is solider to the motherboard.  Likewise the RAM.  Now, if that were the only problem, well -- one would be able to get someone skilled to replace these broken pieces after Apple stop warranty coverage -- maybe.  But, they don't even allow the suppliers of these chips to supply them to the public.  So, once the warranty is. up -- you will not be able to get spare parts for the computer.  Needless to say, this is a major flaw in Apple products -- of which it is no exception for this MacBook Air.  (Oh, and if they start allowing suppliers to supply, but, lock down with crypto keys to a particular machine we just have even more e-waste.)Also, this computer flickers with a 4K output.  The MacBook Air has screen flicker with an external monitor using the HooToo dock that I've used with an Intel MacBook Pro which is a few years old.  This is unacceptable.  Apple's response to the sometimes frying the computer for using USB-C docks that work with other computers is an example of the poorly built computer they are pushing.Though poorly engineered in terms of video, ssd, and RAM.  It is a wonderful typing experience when using the laptop keyboard.  If you are willing to let that guide you, then, the computer may be worth it if you are willing to set aside another grand when ssd fails or you plug in the wrong dock to drive an external monitor even though someone else just had their Intel Mac plugged in and worked just fine.  (Supposedly Apple fix this with an OS update -- good for them.)Even though I dislike the Mac, it is better than most laptops -- because it is quiet since it has no fan.  Would I buy one again? Perhaps -- it is a question of whether I think the market exists for me to make money off of it.The good things:Keyboard, touchpad, Built-In Screen, Build-In Speakers, Drives External Audio better than Microsoft Windows, and the Operating System is less cluttered than is Windows.  Also, comes with a Spreadsheet, Word Processor, Presentation Program -- now, it is better just to use something really Libre -- like LibreOffice.  But, it is kind of nice the table steaks are included -- unlike for Microsoft Windows."

I’ve been using a Windows gaming PC with an i7 9700k processor and 16 gigs of ram for audio production with a lot of amp simulators (processor intensive) and sample libraries (ram intensive). I needed to be able to create music on the go and I wasn’t sure the M1 was up for the task since desktop processors perform better than mobile processors. Boy was I wrong. I reached more than double the amount of amp sims as my desktop PC could do and was still only at 50% processor usage! These ARM processors are so much more efficient than Intel so if you’re looking to do audio production on the go, the M1 is the way to go. I do wish I got the 1tb or 2tb though to avoid needed to keep an external hard drive plugged in though so get as much storage as you can possibly afford"

Transferring files etc from my previous Mac was a snap and now I have my ""old"" Mac on the M1 so everything works better.

No reason to buy any other laptop right now."

But if you looking for an upgrade this is it, beautiful look, sleek design, light, powerful. will last from freshman year of college to well in post grad career. i say every mac with proper care can last a good 5-6 years then should be handed down to a friend.

Nice that it uses a USB C plug to charge, it can be plugged in at any USB C plug. The only thing is that it only has two USB C ports. No SD or micro SD reader. I used an external Seagate hard drive with my windows laptop and now use it with the mac, just had to download free software from Seagate. The hard drive has 2 USB A ports that I can use to connect some of my devices that don't have a USB C plug. But this MacBook Air is super cool.

It's also the new ARM/M1 chip, so certain programs haven't caught up (as of early 2021), especially virtualization (VMWare, VirtualBox) and languages (Haskell).  This is a 13-inch screen, so screen real estate is limited, I couldn't recommend this as a ""daily driver"", except maybe for school/university.  Probably a great option if you're frequently on Google Meet or Zoom.Overall: amazing battery life; unmatched 3D power for the size & price; gorgeous screen with no color/brightness lost when tilted nor LCD configuration needed to optimize color, white/black levels; Mac OS Big Sur is constantly fast and responsive with smooth animation regardless of what is open/running.I've bought a lot of laptops, but this one surprisingly nice.

I now have a Macbook Air with the M1 processor (SOC = system on a chip) that  DESTROYS my 2020 Macbook Pro with an Intel chip.The Air machines don't even have a cooling fan which means it runs silently! It has handled everything I currently do without breaking a sweat and it even can run Parallels with Windows 10 on ARM better than a Surface Pro X.These M1-powered machines are incredible. Unless you have a specific need for an Intel-based machine or you have a very proprietary application that is not yet compatible with the M1, I strongly recommend you consider a unit such as this Macbook Air, the similar Macbook Pro or even the Mac Mini (all available with the M1)."

Stupid fast, great battery and a wonderful premium feel that no other laptop can match. This apple m1 processor is a beast and should scare the heck out of intel. This baby plays Minecraft and high settings with good frame rate, and pairs up amazingly with my other apple devices. Apple is really pushing hard to bring a great product here, at a competitive price. In the thin and light laptop market, apple destroys the windows laptops in every way."

Screen size is the same (thinner bezzle around the edges).I am going to give it 5 stars because... come on!  Apple's own M1 processor!  But I will throw in a provisio.  Google's chrome (native for the M1 processor) seg-faults quite a bit on this unit, though it has slowly been getting better as Google has updated the application to work better with the M1.  I do expect google will fix these issues over the next few weeks, it is a very new system after all and a new architecture target for chrome.  But beware of that.I do wish Apple had kept the mag-safe power supply, but I'm not gonna dock Apple any stars for using USB-C for charging.-Matt"

I have very little need for the camera so it doesn’t bother me personally. But the camera is absolutely embarrassing for what has been named the laptop of the year by many, and I would agree, it’s a great computer. Great battery life, super fast charging, very light, not quiet—silent. Quiet implies there is a minimal amount of noise. There is no fan in this and it’s is literally silent.

YES. It’s the whole reason I bought it, so good for me. How is rendering audio or video? Good, BUT…My iMac 5k from 2017 with 4gb of video ram is faster with the few renderings I have done. The following is what surprised me (especially after reading all the fab reviews of battery): I put my Mac Air on sleep mode when I shut it down. Didn’t use it for a couple days, came back to get it and the battery was completely dead. Zero! I was VERY surprised.  I can always leave an MSI, Lenovo, HP, on sleep mode for a week or more. Those are the things I have experienced in my first week. Hope it helps."

That's literally the only reason I bought it to customize an app that was iOS compatible only. Outside of that, the Camera is horrendous (its giving very 2011 photobooth camera quality) and if you have too many browsers or apps opens it practically crashes. Not really worth the prices in my opinion. Just pay the premium for a macbook pro if the camera and performance is a make or break for you."

It is very lightweight and sleek.The color (gold) is also very pretty, but keep in mind that it is more of a pinkish gold than a yellow gold. However, the camera quality is not great for such an otherwise powerful laptop. Especially in this era of zooming and FaceTiming, a good camera is essential in a laptop. It's not terrible, but its not great either. Another thing - the front lid of the MacBook got a couple of scratches very easily. I was able to get them off, but I would suggest getting a good quality case to ensure that this doesn't happen. All in all I would rate this Macbook a 4.5/5! Definitely lived up to the hype!"

It was an improvement but is not perfect.  Price wise it is an excellent buy and a lot cheaper than other Apple offerings.  I was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to transfer data and applications using time machine with Apple migration assistant.  The display is outstanding. What I don’t like is the lack of ports and no MagSafe connection for power.  And I prefer Catalina over Big Sur but maybe I’ll get used to it.  Also if you plan on keeping it for more than a couple of years and take a lot of pictures or movies 256 GB is not enough memory.  Get at least 512.

I'm thrilled with the added battery life on the new device and amazed by the speed difference between my Intel-based mini vs. the M1.  Out of the box, adding a full charge, the new Mac estimates 19+ hours of battery life.  I've been using the computer for three hours, four open apps, and have bumped the battery gauge to 98%.  Think I've eliminated battery anxiety.  App launches are two to three times faster on the Air vs. my Mini.  The new laptop is zippy!

I actually loved my Dell in many ways, though hopefully its life, around 4-5 years, is about half what this Mac will be.Things I'm missing the most so far, a touch screen, the ability to fully open ie fold-back and flatten the rotation the screen, even the fact of needing to use 3 fingers to take screen-shots instead of an allocated button, the delete button is actually a back-space not delete button. Notifications keep coming in upper right corner, blocking what I might want to access there. One needs to go through each app to change the setting btw, there's no default to say do not show notifications. It would at least be good to have the option to change the location of where they show up. I much prefer chrome to safari, though found on reading that chrome eats up a lot more power. I downloaded Flotata this morning which is supposed to help though I haven't tried yet. Incredibly frustrating especially when time is very limited, trying to figure things out!! Have spent hours on calls with Apple support which thankfully is very accessible. But my computer seems glitchy, sometimes the screen-sharing doesn't work. I haven't purchased a mouse as yet for it and also finding ""right-clicking"" with 2 finger tapping to be frustrating and not working as I'd expect it to.Overall unfortunately not a happy camper. Maybe for Mac users it may be a good machine for whatever reason.I was also very torn whether to get the 8 or 16gb, I went with the 8. I don't think that would make a difference at this early stage of being new.I also tried to have my teen daughter, who's used to Macs, give me tips though she was't terribly helpful so I watched a couple of YouTube vids which gave some guidance, things are not intuitive.I don't like posting negative reviews, though sharing this in case others in similar situations ie needing to carry on with trying to get things done, while their windows laptop is reaching the end of its life and needing to choose a new machine, may find this helpful.Also as an fyi, I had to pay an additional nearly $300 to have my 2 external hard-drives transferred onto a new Mac compatible one, so I can access all my previous work.Wishing everyone better luck!"

 Bought this laptop bc i needed it for spring semester and i needed an upgrade from my heavy macbook pro. I go to work too so i needed something super light and thin i can just bring everywhere and slide it in my bag.I am obsessed with how fast this macbook is. The battery life is on point. I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.I love the color. The main reason why i bought this too. 😍😂I have no problems with it at all.Highly recommend"

The battery life is amazing and I have been able to complete work tasks easily. I love the size because I can carry the MacBook when I travel without having to use a big laptop bag. The screen quality is great, but I had a little difficulty seeing the screen outside in a sunny area. Although, when I found some shade I had no problems at all. I am not outside much in the sun on the MacBook so this isn’t a big deal for me. Overall, great product in my opinion. It is perfect for what I need to do for work."

It is lightning fast, smooth, clear easy to read screen  and the battery lasts and lasts for all day and then some. Also I have noticed that with any normal use it doesn't even get warm so the lack of a fan is not a detriment but nice as a nonexistent fan can't make any noise. I was slightly skeptical but as a multiple APPLE owner not surprised I was happy. Seriously I just sent a 3 year old iPad that had been used hard daily for a battery replacement and received a brand new iPad 3 days after I sent it in. Thats service as well."

First off, the mouse buttons are a new horrible design that often do not recognize mouse clicks. Clicking this mouse is the worst experience I’ve ever had on any computer before. My previous 2018 Mac was much better in so many ways.Also i hate that this new Mac only has 2 ports both being USB-c. One is used to charge which means you only have a single USB-c port for use. Another huge downgrade.Also this Mac has the fancy new fingerprint scanner unlock and yet it forces me to re-enter my password constantly. So what is the point of a fingerprint scanner if i still need to re-enter my password 80% of the time?The keyboard also feels cheap and is very uncomfortable to use, another downgrade from my 2018 Mac.

I purchased this item over the holidays and got a great deal by selecting the 18 month interest-free payment plan. However there was NOTHING indicating that I needed to change my automatic payment settings in order for this plan to actually work (except for an email I received the day AFTER the full amount was charged). I first called Chase who told me they could refund the amount - but that they could not reinstate the payment plan promo that Amazon offered and I would be charged interest until the balance was paid off. Then I called Amazon who said there was nothing they could do and I needed to call Chase. I am beyond furious and severely disappointed with Amazon for not making this apparently necessary step more clear from the very beginning. I purchased this laptop to start my own business and now I am going into it with an overdrawn account. I hope my review  helps someone else avoid this mess.

The loading of web pages is truly pathetic, especially for 2021 and especially for the processor. The usual crap about speeding up the loading time is the usual garbage, 'clear the cache, is there enough room on the HD...' bla bla bla...' The damn thing is absurdly slow. The build quality is exceptional, the case is +, etc., and using the box offline is fine in terms of speed, but loading web pages, getting hung up on web pages, etc. is just plain BS. If anyone has any real advise on how to speed this thing up I would appreciate it but I am seriously thinking about returning it... My 2012 Lenova is actually faster. My INT is a fiber optics with plenty of juice..."

Hopefully I will be able to return it, but either way it is going to be a hassle. A big reason I bought this was that I was tired of my windows laptop taking forever on windows updates and often being slow, but at least that thing can turn on.Very disappointed with this I thought one of the big selling points with mac products was that they ""just work"". When I first opened it after it arrived, it would not turn on. I figured ok, I thought they come with some battery life but I guess I have to charge it. It turned on ONCE after charging it for a bit and then never again. After I went through the initial setup config I closed the laptop to let it finish charging. I came back an hour later and it would not turn on! I have tried charging it. I have tried plugging the charger into a different outlet. I have reseated the usb-c cable and tried both ports. I have held down the power button for 10+ seconds. I have tried hitting control + command + power. It doesn't do anything doesn't even make a boot up sound it just won't turn on.

I got it here on Amazon for $200 less than what they sell for on Apple’s website. I bought it to replace my 10 year old MacBook Pro that has performed flawlessly. Unfortunately this new MacBook Air was defective from the start. It would crash frequently with this weird pink screen of death. It would come back up with a MacOS kernel panic log.  I would also get the spinning beach ball. And it would randomly reboot itself, even when I wasn’t using it. We can only speculate on why this MacBook Air was such a good deal. Returning it for a refund was not easy and required a phone call to Amazon then a scheduled pickup from my home with an adult."

After being guaranteed by a supervisor that I would receive my complete amount of purchase refund , and waived as a one time courtesy the restocking fee, I would have no problem with this ; all I would have to do is call back after they initiated the first part of the refund when they received the computer back—- and on another call to see what was the status because it had been the time for them to have received the computer back already, another customer service assured me that it was noted again he saw as a one time courtesy I would receive the waived restocking fee, I would just need to wait again until Monday .

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Buyer Beware,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2022",1.0,"I purchased a MacBook Air (Late 2020) from Amazon on September 17th.  After a week of use, the screen has lines on it.  Before the 30-day return window was up, I brought it to the apple store (twice).  The Apple Store, would not replace the unit and the staff would not send the unit out to be fixed at no cost. The store claimed “damage” was done to the laptop.  An unacceptable response where the laptop was used over a week with normal use, on a desk. This is a defect, not “damage”.  Additionally, employee at the Apple Store, said that he could only “swap it out” if we purchased it from Apple directly.  This is unacceptable, I purchased this unit from Amazon which is an authorized Apple Retailer.  The same policies need to be applied, or why bother having authorized retailers.The screens on the M1 MacBook Airs are fragile and are of poor quality.  Apple won’t stand behind its product and fix it. Amazon will take back the laptop and I’m getting a full refund.  Apple needs to address the screen issue on their laptops, improve their warranty and retrain staff.  The M1 MacBook Air has poor components, poor warranty and the Apple staff are not handling these issues well.  Apple is blaming customers for Apple’s poor build quality."

However, there are significant unresolved issues from the hardware side of things: 1. there is a known problem with disk usage related to RAM disk swap (from what I understand) and media-heavy usage (why I bought this laptop) deteriorates the SSD quickly. 2. the FaceTime camera is absolutely terrible. There is no other way to put this. It may be the worst camera I have seen on any device since my iPhone 3G. The picture is incredibly blurry, and not suitable for the COVID/virtual environment. There have been issued raised about this in Apple support forums with no resolution.Unfortunately my return window has passed, but I would not recommend this machine to anyone.

Bought brand new, won’t buy a MacBook next time. Haven’t used it once since I got it. Heard they were so much better than androids. Don’t think so."

I sent it back unopened today. Still not sure there was a MacBook Air in there, it was so miniature in size."

Loved the Magic Keyboard, but everything else seems half-baked Apple.I didn't know enough to immerse myself in the (hard-to-find)  Essentials Manual before touching the FORCE touchpad.  Took a long time that to realize that ""force""  really meant FORCE (as in ""smash it down"" )  There is a System Preferences bypass, but I got embroiled in a DARK MODE display (black screen), missing cursor, and of course loss of Intel-chip based favorite apps which all took precedence over trying to find and read a possible Manual.  Help menu did not help..I tried, I really did.  Apple Support suggested and helped for 2 days, with hours spent trying over & over to erase, then Reinstall Big Sur  software, but 2 hours loading (for each of dozens of tries), then ""An error occurred preparing this update.  Please try again.""was too much, over and over.  This software is not ready for primetime.  Looking forward to AIR's next iteration.Meanwhile, I must be content with my older MacBook Pro, while MacBoo Air is returned:  ""rest in peace""."

Next morning get MacBook number 2- super excited because I open it and it comes on and sings a song! Loved it for the 3 hours it worked.  It updated and Locked me out.  Did everything they told me to do online, call Apple that admits they are having this issue and I can return it for another one! Since it’s not 14 days old.  No thanks.  I am done.  Since Apple told me to return it this time Amazon was amazing and is picking it up for return tomorrow.  This was a crappy experience.  I love my iPad Pro and iPhones- no more MacBook for me."

However, the one port is a non starter for me. I opened it started it up and one I realized I had to buy accessories to add anything additional, I cleaned it and packed back up to return. One port is horribly inconvenient for my needs, and having to carry around an accessory to add even one more is a waste of my energy. I can and will purchase something more adaptable and suited to my needs"

Company is terrible for customer service,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 5, 2021",1.0,Nothing wrong with the MacBook itself. It was just not practical for me what I needed for my work. So I started a return. First you send them the product I guess in good faith. Then once they receive the item then with in 7 days they will refund your purchase. Mind you I returned this in the complete original package only 4 days after receiving it. It’s going on 2 months and nothing but Crickets from everyone. Buyer Beware!!

I was told that we would just do the refund, and i could rebuy it.. my refund seems to be taking a while, and it looks like the prices just went up on top of it. So im not very happy right now. i want to get the replacement. Def going to get the apple care plan (which also looks like it went up in price)  from like 2 days ago"

The pro was thicker and a fair amount heavier so hauling both sucked sometimes.I'm sure some heavy dev's, gamers or power photoshop users that need a remote workstation away from their Mac Pro (or Mac Studio) a MacBook Pro may be a better options but that comes with the negative of a bigger form factor, bigger and heavier power adapter and a bit more cost.I think this is a great fit for knowledge workers, it blows my new Lenovo Win laptop for work out of the water) and still handles large card imports from my SLR and Mirrorless cameras like a champ.

If it was in this price bracket all the time, it would be a no brainer best choice, and I am having a hard time finding worthy competition even at its $1,000 msrp range.What it does well:Trackpad-  The trackpad on the MacBook Air is unbelievable. Using pressure sensitivity to simulate clicks on a piece of glass, the MacBook lineup puts all other laptop manufacturers on notice. This is a best in class experience.Keyboard-  Say what you will about laptop keyboards but this is a phenomenal typing experience. The only type of keyboard I would rather be using is a mechanical keyboard, but in this form factor, it is as good as it gets. The only complaints I have are that the arrow keys are really small.Display-  The display provides a fantastic viewing experience. I thought this is where the laptop would fall behind its more expensive counterparts with OLED and Mini LED displays, but the color accuracy, respectable 400 nit peak brightness, and 2560 x 1600 resolution are leaps better than anything I have experienced on an HP or Lenovo device. I wish the display was slightly bigger, but do not mind using it at all. This is a very good display for the money.Build Quality-  Apple just continues to excel at building things.Speakers-  Solid speakers with exceptional clarity, volume, and bass. Better than anything I have owned before it.What it does bad:Gaming-  Do not buy this laptop with the hopes that you can game on it. Most games I thought of installing were not available on Mac OS. It is in this category that Windows dominates the market.IO-  You get 2 USB C ports and a headphone jack. This fits my lifestyle just fine, but I cannot speak for everyone. It is up to you to determine whether you can live without USB A, HDMI out, or SD Readers built in.Base Hardware-  At this price point, 256gb is not enough. 512 should be the standard, not a $160 add on."

Perfect keyboard, perfect weight, perfect battery life, perfect trackpad, perfect performance, perfect Touch ID, perfect feel, perfect build, perfect look, perfect size, perfect stereo sound, perfect screen, perfect noise absence as not having a fan! I mean, it doesn't have a fan and it doesn't get hot most of the times. WTF?! It's the only laptop I've been able to use in my bed for x amount of hours and it is sooo comfortable to do it. It truly is one of the best products out there and it is totally worth the investment, because that's how I see it, not even as spending, that's just how good it is. I'm enthusiastic because this is for sure the best device Apple has created in terms of price/what you get, and it will probably stay in that position for a couple of years. This is game-changing and revolutionary. The computer feels as if it will last 10+ years, honestly. I highly recommend it. BTW, it is so good my girlfriend decided to get one for herself because she just couldn't get over the first time she used it, and just how beautiful it is and pleasurable to look at from any perspective... This laptop is so ridiculously perfect that you can even open it with one hand and in just a couple of seconds, you will be ready to use it as it has an always-on feature that allows you to get down to the working right away. That is probably the best feat. True Tone is also really good, as it is automatic brightness adjustment and dark mode, they sit together perfectly well. Get it! You won't regret it at any moment. Truly a high-end experience. Oh, and... It looks elegant at any angle, and which is most important, classy it feels."

Apple has had many MacBook models throughout their many years of being the best electronic company, but The BigSur OS has many features that other models and other company computers do not have. This MacBook comes with high quality upload speed, all-day battery life, and superfast memory, which makes it the best choice for any computer or laptop right now. For a student and any other user, upload speed is definitely one of the most important qualities on a computer. This MacBook’s upload speed is fast enough that it can be considered a gaming laptop also. It has an Apple M1 Chip with an eight-core CPU which delivers up to almost four times as fast as past generations. This M1 Chip is designed by Apple designers themselves which other companies do not have access to. This BigSur is the quickest computer on the computer and laptop market which puts Apple as the highest revenue electronic company. Battery-life is another quality that is essential to many people, especially a student in the year 2021. Many universities and high schools have switched to using mainly online tests, textbooks, notes, and activities. All day battery-life is important because some students are using their computer up to nine hours a day with school, homework, and studying for tests and quizzes. This MacBook uses lithium polymer batteries which provide up to 18 hours of battery life. These batteries also are good for the environment and conservation. These are the best batteries for computers because they provide the best life and are good for the environment. Good memory and lots of storage are also crucial qualities of a computer. This MacBook can be used for up to ten years if there are not any software problems. This MacBook has eight GB of unified memory that makes everything you do have fast upload speed and responsiveness. Having enough memory and storage is great. For example, a student or a teacher would need to save documents, projects, notes and many more things. If there is not enough storage to do those things that a student needs to do then things will end up lost and not recovered. A lot of storage is also needed for a gamer because there needs to be space to download the games and have room for any spontaneous updates that might occur. Good memory and storage are important to many people and that's what makes the BigSur OS the best computer on the market. The MacBook BigSur has many pros that other computers just do not have and is a reasonable price for all the features it comes with. This model is an amazing choice for students, teachers, gamers, engineers, IT workers, and anyone who uses their computer a lot. The MacBook BigSur OS definitely continues to be one of the top rated computers and gives users a big bang for their buck."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",It was a great product!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 17, 2021",5.0,"Through the past year and a half, students have had to use personal computers and laptops for everyday tasks, most importantly being school. From my personal experience I believe that the MacBook Air 2020 is the best tool for the job. If you plan to frequently use a personal computer or laptop in the future, the MacBook Air is the right choice because of its processing speed and storage, ability to keep a charge, and the apple compatibility that it uses.First, the MacBook Air 2020 is amazingly convenient to use throughout the day because of its ability to hold a charge and how quickly it gets charged. In my school days I did not have very much time to worry about the battery life of my computer. Now I do not have to do that at all because I only need to charge my computer once to twice a week and its 30 hour charge. Next, the apple compatibility that it uses, including Apple music, iMessage, Facetime, etc., makes this product very easy to use while not having to use multiple devices to do actions such as getting a photo from your photos or getting that one picture from a text. This apple compatibility lets you see all of these things and not have to worry about changing devices to do so. Finally, is the processing speed and storage. The MacBook Air 2020 has a processor that is considered to be great for gaming and running large applications within the computer. This makes the computer amazingly fast while doing average school work and using it for everyday life. Although it is expensive, the MacBook Air has been considered to be the best for its price out of all of the MacBooks, including computers such as the MacBook Pro. The strange thing that the MacBook has is amazing showing its slim appearance and lightweight feel. The storage that is available with the MacBook is 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB, but most went with 512GB. These large amounts of storage are fantastic, showing that one of the MacBook Air's biggest competitors(Dell XPS 13) only lets you choose between 128GB and 256GB. Now if you want to have a large amount of pictures or apps on your computer that kind of storage just won't cut it. For these reasons the MacBook Air 2020 is the best choice for daily use and school work because of its processing speed and storage, ability to keep a charge, and the apple compatibility.Overall, the MackBook Air has the processing speed, storage capacity, battery life, and the apple compatibility to make it the best choice for a laptop or personal computer. Throughout the last year and a half, I have had to be on my computer a lot to do school work and many other things. Getting this computer has not only helped me do this quicker, but has improved the quality of my work because of its nice layout and convenience."

The M1 chip almost never struggles, opening apps and web pages in seconds.SCREENThe screen is very high resolution with little glare.

Messages, photos, websites, and mail from your phone just appear on your laptop.I don’t know if another laptop that hits all these points for under $1000.Now as for the cons…Not enough storage - 256gb is not enough. You can get by if all you do is browse the web and use Microsoft word, but for anything beyond that you’ll need AT LEAST 512gb.Gaming - macOS has a very small selection of gaming options. It’s not a gaming machine, but it’s laughably small.For the games it does have, the fps and speed is reasonable. It’s not incredible, but like I said it’s not a gaming machine."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",The Macbook Is Great!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 17, 2021",5.0,"Macbook Review Apple has created many technological wonders throughout the time of the business, and the Mac is no exception. I have had different laptops before highschool, like Chromebooks, so I knew what I liked and did not like. After about two months of searching, I landed on the Macbook.  When researching which laptop to buy for highschool, I landed upon the Macbook for its reliable battery, the great software, and the modern features brought by the Macbook, like touch I.D. and Siri. The modern aspects of the Macbook are beyond great, and serve many purposes that other laptops fail to incorporate. The first one is fingerprint recognition. When I had old laptops, I always had to remember every character of the password, and it was just a plain hassle. Now, however, Apple has a fingerprint scanner built into the computer itself, which I find extremely useful. Between my school passwords, my home passwords, and other important information, that is a lot to keep track of. Now, though, all I need is my fingerprint and I can get into all of my accounts with my fingerprint. Also, the Macbook comes with Siri, a virtual assistant to do tasks and find different files on the Mac. There are many different papers, files, and websites needed to keep track of, and finding all those efficiently is almost impossible on your own. But, Siri makes it easier. To activate Siri, all you have to do is simply say “Hey, Siri” and the assistant will appear. Siri responds to what is said, so if I say, “Hey Siri, find ‘Review 2’ from Google Drive,” the document will appear seconds later. Although the modern technologies of the Macbook are important, just as important is the software. Many laptops lack the software that a high-end desktop would have, but this does not apply to Apple’s Macbook. First, the Mac has capabilities that of gaming desktop computers. Safari is the Mac’s main browser, so what happens if for some reason I need to use Google Chrome? Well, the Mac has the ability to run not only two but three different utilities at once, Google Chrome, Safari, and Bing. Also, the software of the mac allows you to also play desktop games when you want to. Most laptops are meant for business or school, like the Macbook, but not all of them can perform as well as the Mac for games. Sometimes, after school, I explore and test the limits of my laptop just to get a sense for what the max is. I expected the Macbook to do somewhat poorly, but I thought that it actually did pretty well. Another reason why the Macbook is great is because of the battery. The batteries for every computer seem the same, but once looked at in-depth, not all batteries are equal. The Macbook has a very long battery life compared to another laptop, like a Chromebook. When I first used my Macbook, I used it without charging it until it needed it. How long did it last after starting at 50%? Almost one day with no charge. The Chromebook I had when I was in middle school would need to be charged after about five hours of use. Also, the battery uses an optimizing system. When the battery is below 30%, the system turns the battery power done, and thus turns down the brightness of the screen. This helps to maintain the battery for a longer period of time. Not only is the battery great, but for many other reasons this is the best laptop I have had. The Macbook is a modern, efficient laptop for not only students but for all kinds of people. From the battery life, to the software and the modern features, the Macbook is a great laptop to use, no matter who you are and what you do. The Mac will change not only how to get things done, but your view of a laptop forever."

In the past 10-12 hours, I've been using photoshop and Final Cut Pro, finishing my essay and FaceTiming a old friend, it is amazing-M1, the processor is super fast, even though this thing doesn't have a fan, it doesn't get hot at all, I have not seen this thing get warm a single time.-The keyboard, let me put it this way, it is VERY SATISFYING, many people have many opinions about it, but I come from using a MacBook 2017 and Asus Vivobook, this keyboard is very good, has great travel and it isn't mushy.-Display is also very good, gets bright enough, even in direct sunlight and keyboard backlight is adjustable, something I haven't been able to do on my windows laptops.CONS:-App support, plainly putting it, app support sucks other than applications that are optimized for the m1, even as of 2022, but my main apps work, like Final Cut Pro, photoshop and Lightroom.-Webcam sucks, it's still 720p, and much worse than my Asus, it's serviceable but not good."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray","The perfect laptop (for me, and maybe you)","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 8, 2022",5.0,"Over the past 10 years, I've had five MacBook Airs and three MacBook Pros (my employer provides a new one for my work every few years, and I upgrade my own at home every 1-2 years).  Most recently, my personal computer has been an early 2020 intel quad core MacBook Pro and my work computer an early 2020 MacBook Air.  The brand new M1 MacBook Air is my favorite by far, and fixes everything I didn't like about the MacBook Air & Pro introduced in early 2020.The M1 MB Air's battery life is amazing, I can use it all day and still have 50-60% battery remaining.  My previous MB Air and MB Pro gave me around 5-6 hours of battery life (despite Apple promising ~10 hours) - which was barely enough to get me through the day.I'm also loving the the fanless design, silent operation, and increased performance.  Even though I don't do much video editing, my workflow can be taxing on the computer:  I regularly run lots of apps simultaneously, including Zoom for teaching, many open browser windows, Excel & statistical/database software, and a connected iPad I use as a digital whiteboard when teaching over Zoom.  The new M1 MacBook Air handles this easily, and does not get hot despite the lack of a fan.  The MB Pro I've used since April (the one introduced in early 2020 with Intel quad core processors) also handles this load well, but it gets warmer and fans kick on sometimes.  The early 2020 MacBook Air buckled under this load, it gets very hot and the fans are screaming.Besides the better battery life, silent operation, and robust performance, the new M1 MB Air has a display with better colors and a slightly better webcam compared to previous MB Airs.The MB Air's display doesn't get as bright as the MB Pro's display - that has been true for years, but it has never been a problem for me.  I would only need the display to be brighter if I were working outside on a sunny day, and I just don't do that.I really love the keyboard on the new M1 MacBook Air, which is the same as the keyboard on the early 2020 MB Air & Pro, and MUCH improved IMHO from the butterfly keyboards on the previous MB Airs & Pros.  It is quiet and super comfortable for typing.  When typing very fast, my accuracy is higher on this keyboard than on the butterfly-style keyboards.This is subjective, but I really prefer the MB Air form factor - the wedge shape and slightly lower weight - compared to the MB Pro.  I also strongly dislike the MB Pro's Touch Bar.  I've had two different MB Pros with Touch Bars and they were nothing but trouble for me.  When typing fast, my fingers would sometimes slightly graze the edge of the Touch Bar, which would trigger a command (like launching the Music app), which would interrupt my workflow.  I know other people don't have that problem, and other people find the Touch Bar useful, but it's just not for me.For me, the MB Air speakers (on this and on the previous model) are quite good for movies or YouTube videos or Zoom/Facetime calls.  The microphone is perfectly satisfactory, though for Zoom calls or when making my own instructional videos I usually plug in a cheap external mic which is a little better.The webcam is still disappointing, even though image quality is SLIGHTLY improved over previous MacBooks.The external design is exactly the same as MacBook Airs from years past.  I like the design pretty well, but Apple will redesign the MB Air & Pro in the next year or so to reduce the bezels which will allow a bigger screen without increasing the size of the computer.  I will want one of those and might regret that I didn't wait.But for now, the M1 MacBook Air is the best MacBook I've ever had, it fixes everything that I didn't like about previous MacBooks (except the webcam) and offers me a really great computing experience in just about every way."

To some extent this has indeed proved true and useful.  I am coming from a Surface Pro 7.  The Mac Air's battery life is much less than advertised.  The claim is around 10 hours, I doubt I get 5, and I am mostly doing internet browsing and Word stuff.  Battery life from fully charged was about 1 hour while on Zoom.  The battery life of the Surface is better.  Word for Mac is a little different than Word for a PC, but the differences are minor and manageable.  But documents open more slowly on the Mac, and mine has the M1 chip.  On the Surface, documents usually open immediately.  On the Mac it might take 5 seconds, not an eternity, but a little annoying.  The Surface boots up much faster than the Mac.  I have a DVD with a number of workouts on it.  I could not get any individual workouts to open using the Mac's native software.  So I downloaded VLC.  It works fine on the Mac, but takes a long time to open, about a minute.  This seems to be true of any software not downloaded from the App store, including Firefox.  There do not appear to be Mac apps for either.  On the other hand, the Mac has a better screen than the Surface.  While the Surface is quite a good laptop, it is a marginal tablet, and I almost never use it as a tablet.  When I am not sitting at a desk, I prefer the Mac because the two parts cannot come apart as can happen on a Surface.  The new Mac keyboard works great, maybe a tie with the Surface.  So a mixed bag.  As I mentioned, I like having everything in one ecosystem, so likely that is enough of a benefit to keep the Mac.  I am mulling over upgrading to the MacBook Pro 13 because of its bigger battery, but don't know if I want to spend the extra money."

Only downside is that a lot of apps are not designed for the M1 chip and despite there being virtual desktops for Windows out on the market the performance is still a little shoddy.

Warcraft 3 and StarCraft worked no problem since they were converted to 64 bit. Problem is TF2 is still 32 bit and it will not run on my Mac. I got this Mac on special at Costco with the M1 chip. Amazing I can get 60 fps on a passive cooled chip. Great build quality and battery life. Poor application on apples part to prematurely discontinue 32 bit applications. That’s just unacceptable, and I had to return it. I will switch over to Mac in 10 years when apps are converted or no longer used."

It's fine folks like what they like for me, Linux gives the most choice is extensible, and runs so fast on even older hardware, you get infinite support you don't get harassed to use cortana, siri, candy crush itunes etc etc.  Mac usually they push you so hard in this echo system for a lot of stuff i really don't like. it used to be just getting music out of itunes was a pain.well here we are in 2021. I mainly work on linux these days, and wanted a unix style mac because working remote i just needed something with microsoft office, i need that. i am not doing windows development these days. I know there is wsl but there are trade offs on windows. not with mac --  for my use case, so i tried it... gave it another shot really. My timing was seemingly really good. these computer are fantastic. You know what i hate about laptops. when they are 150 degrees melting your nuts and it sounds like you have a jet pack on. I hate that i really do. All of my laptops do this. The mac M1 I am pleased to report doesn't. Screw performance i mean that's great here, but the quiet and note heat that's the feature.This is coming from someone that doesn't want to like Apple. They outsource all these jobs, their stuff is over priced right? I'm not so  sure about the price here. You can buy a mac pro 13 inch that's faster than an i9 for 1500 (if you get 16gb), and the battery is amazing, no heat, no fan, the sound is great, the screen is great, the keyboard is great, it's not a lenovo, but other than that it's about as good as you can get. This machine is so well thought out. I got the pro, the reason i take a lot of calls and wanted the slightly better sound, and boosted battery,but if you don't need that you can just get the air which doesn't have the horrible touch bar. Don't get me wrong. the touch bar would be fine IN ADDITION to normal keys. that's where they went wrong here they got greedy. I digress. The only other issue i see here is the connectivity sucks. It needs ports on both sides and at least 2x ports.All these reviews are usually full of crap. It's just people getting free hardware and writing reviews so they can take a tax deduction, or they are sort marketing. This time it's true. This architecture is a significant advance especially in the laptop space. I 'm not sure if this will translate to a desktop-- risc vs cisc isn't new it been going on for decades, but  for laptops, this is a quantum leap. I don't see any reason for the work i'm doing to use a desktop computer a this point. i have complete portability, i can take calls (amazing calls), work on ms office, general development (vscode, all the jetbrains stuff, docker etc)... i mean for a lot of system stuff i'll still use I'd still use linux, but for work this is a great way to go. What a great product. It really really is. This i as strong of an endorsement i can give if you just need to be productive. After 8 months of hell no more fumbeling around with TPM chips, mics, no being able to share my screen, pleading with my computer to use the right audio device. I like it better than any other laptop i have ever had by far.This thing is really just that good. I've been i this industry for a long time. There are going to have to be some changes in competitors product lines, if Apple continues to maintain this price point and deliver a product of this caliber. I have no question this one is going to eat market share fast. I'd imagine there will be a strong response fro Intel, amd and the software companies.  It's difficult to justify purchasing any other laptop at this moment. I mean just get the air for 1200, just get the extra ram. maybe 500 gb. That's all most people are going to need. Who cares if they release better ones in 6 months. they always do they'll probably cost too much. this is all you need."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Still impressed with how awesome this new laptop is!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2022",5.0,"I am a life-long fan of all things Apple.  That being said, after using this laptop for a little over a month, I am still impressed with how awesome this laptop is!  The battery life alone leaves me in awe.  I bought this laptop to use as an online student.  Starting with the battery fully charged, I am easily able to complete all of my online coursework and have plenty of battery power left to stream a movie or two afterwards.  I actually purchased my MacBook Air M1 laptop directly from Apple so I would get the student discount.  I did choose to upgrade my RAM to the 16 GB for an additional $180, and that did cause delivery to take a little longer.  Totally worth it though!  I have not done anything yet on this laptop to really stress-test it, but I have had multiple webpages in the browser, and multiple documents open in Word and PDF docs open with iBooks and Preview.  I have had no problems at all switching between open web sites, apps, or docs.  The only time I started to notice any hint of a problem, it turns out it was because we lost power and therefore our home WiFi was temporarily unavailable, so it had nothing to do with the laptop.While it is a minor inconvenience that Netflix is not available for download thru the app store at this time (Oct 2021), it is easy enough to access their streaming service thru the browser.  The built in speakers are plenty loud enough, but it is quite easy to use your AirPods if you prefer.I highly recommend this MacBook Air M1 to anyone, especially students, looking for a laptop that has a battery that will actually keep up with them all day long without constantly needing to find a power outlet."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Fantastic laptop,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2022",5.0,"When I was in college, I used both mac and PC and after I graduated I switched exclusively to PC because of the versatility (gaming and upgradability). When I decided to go back to grad school, I decided to give Apple another chance with this laptop because I heard great things and high expectation with the new m1 chip design. I was not disappointed.This new CPU has great speeds and this macbook air runs fantastic for daily moderate use (browsing the web, watching videos, reading, studying, etc. ). I can go to a cafe and use this laptop all day without having to charge it. Also, it's so compact and thin that it's easy to take everywhere! compared to my old macbook from 2012, it is incredibly light. I always had the notion that apple made heavy laptops, but this definitely is easy to carry around.As someone who used a desktop, the keyboard was a bit harder to adapt to. The keys don't have a deep switch as a normal keyboard has, but considering the size of the laptop, it is expected. I can see it being an issue with its small screen. Although it is convenient for me, the size can be inconvenient for those hard of sight. Lastly, the price is steep for a laptop. A PC variant with this money can be used to buy a gaming laptop where Apple normally lacks, but I have yet to try the Apple Arcade on my macbook air. It is also only USB-C which is a turn-off to many, but with a dongle, it is not a problem for me.I would say if you are looking for a laptop to work or study with, this is an easy grab. Make sure you buy a dongle along side of it.TL;DRPros:- battery life- m1 chip- size (easy to carry around)- weightCons:- keyboard- size (screen is a bit small for some)- price- only USB-C"

Due to the fact that I am an avid apple user, it is super beneficial that all my photos, passwords, and documents are so conveniently transferred to each of my devices.

Otherwise, the computer is great for college students who do not mind emailing the teacher or going through some loop holes to complete the class."

I chose this for going back to school because I knew it would last longer and not get buggy like Windows always does. While the transition was a bit rocky at first, now that I somewhat know what I'm doing, I absolutely love this computer! It's small and lightweight, but still feel solid in your hands. The processor is incredibly fast as well as the load up time. I can get signed in and have my notes up in seconds (literally, no joke!), something I could never do with a Windows laptop (I should mention that I bought my computer directly from Apple and upgraded to the 16BG RAM and more storage, which helps immensely with load up time). For those that say the camera is bad- I don't think so. Is it the most amazing camera ever? No, but if you really need higher camera quality for your job, then you should probably go with a Macbook Pro instead of Air. For a Zoom meeting it works just fine. The price is obviously higher than many laptops- that's why I've never used Mac until now- but just think of it as an investment. I know I'll be able to use this for years to come!If you are looking for an efficient, reliable laptop with great performance, look no further!"

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Amazing investment!!! 💯,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2022",5.0,"Before I begin, I’d like to clarify that I purchased this MacBook on Apple.com.I was kind of reluctant at first to purchase a MacBook due to the expensive pricing. But it was heard that apple products are long lasting and really good quality. I’ve had. Chromebook for 3 years, and the quality is not amazing. I’ve had to bring it for repair multiple times. It also shut down randomly. But not with this MacBook.The MacBook is soo beautiful, and sleek. The rose gold color is so elegant, and the keys are amazing. At the top right hand corner there is a small button that enables Touch ID which is so convenient and easy to work.By just saying “hey, Siri” my automated assistant is summoned and will help me with whatever I need. It comes with so many apps. And so many ways to customize your MacBook.I changed my profile photo, set a quote on my Lock Screen, changed my wallpapers, made widgets, changed my highlight color, accent colors and much much more.It’s so convenient for me to have my zooms open in one browser and the “pages” app open in another so I can take notes while my teachers gives lessons.As shown in the pictures, if you update your MacBook with Big Sur, you can download “Widgetsmith” and customize widgets! My entire MacBook’s aesthetic is so elegant and I just love it. Comparing this to laptops like HP and Dell, as well as Google, there are limited ways you can customize your laptop to your liking.I asked a couple of friends and family members who have MacBooks, and they have had them for 5+ years, without having to take their MacBooks for repair. I am hoping this will be my case as well.I can now message anyone from the messages app and the mail app.The camera quality is great too! It’s touched up my appearance with zoom and Google meet. and I’ve heard if you want a MacBook to edit, the pro is the way to go because the storage is bigger.The battery life is so great too! I’ve used it for 6+ hours starting at 9am to 4:30 pm. It started at 45 percent and it only went down to 30!!!Buying a MacBook will not water your money! I am loving every second of my use!!! Thank you Apple!!! 💜"

I repaired the keyboard twice, so there must have been something wrong with voltage regulation to it.Anyhow, I couldn't resist the idea of an ARM based Macbook, so I went with the 2020 13"" Macbook Air since I don't think the Pro model had Apple Silicon yet.  I could be wrong on that.Long story short, it meets all my needs with flying colors!  It turns out that I'm perfectly comfortable with a 13"" screen and that I don't need a bigger one.Everything great about this Macbook:- It's *fast*!  Don't let the ""Air"" moniker deceive you.  Unless you're into heavy gaming, this is the laptop for you.  ARM processors are the future of consumer computing.- The battery life is *insane*.  I still can't comprehend how many hours this thing survives unplugged.  I take it on flights across the country and never need to plug in or get worried that I will run out of power, even when I'm charging my phone off it!- It's slim and light!  Perfect for traveling.- It is completely solid state with no moving parts!  No fan whirring or anything like that.- As an extension of the first point, it runs ARM builds of Windows insanely well with Parallels.  It can even run Halo: CE at near full speed!- macOS is very stable.- The retina screen is nice.- Despite what people are saying about the camera, it's actually better than the one on my old Macbook Pro.  (this isn't to say that the camera is *good*, but it's adequate IMO)- All things considered, the M1 Macbook Air is incredible value and really a great deal for the price.- It has a larger touchpad than my old Macbook Pro but not quite as bit as the one on current 13"" Macbook Pros.  I find this preferable because it is just the right size where I'm not constantly hitting it with my palm as I type.  If you type a lot then the touchpad on this laptop will probably annoy you less while still having plenty of surface area.- No touchbar!!!  Halleluja!!!!- Decent sound from the speakers considering the size constraint.There are some cons, but they are pretty minor IMO:- Only the left side has USB-C ports, in contrast to the Pro which has them on both sides.  The right side *does* have an analog audio jack, however, if that's useful to you.  However, I've managed fine without USB on the right side.- It would be nice if I didn't have to click the fingerprint sensor button to get it to sense my finger and wake the system.  On pros, the fingerprint sensor is always active.- If you are one of the 3 people on the planet who want the touchbar, this will not have it. (I however consider this a good thing)- Although the speakers have improved in quality since previous Air models, the Pro is still going to have better sounding speakers.  You may feel like you've gotten a bit of a downgrade in that regard if you are coming from a Pro model.  Personally, I've gotten used to it plus I use AirPods most of the time anyway.- The Air does NOT have an HDMI port, but you can buy an (expensive) adapter that will provide HDMI.- Storage capacity is workable but limited.  Would be nice to get at least 1 TB of storage in the future.  In the meantime I just back stuff up on to an external drive and periodically clear my downloads folder.I'm a software engineer and the M1 Macbook Air exceeds my needs and expectations.  I think I'll just be buying the Air model in the future because it's terrific value for the price point.  $999 might be expensive for some, but I can assure you that it's a robust laptop so you are saving money in the long run.  I've owned many non-Apple laptops in the past and I ended up hating all of them.  On the other hand, I never regret owning an Apple device.  This is coming from someone who formerly used Windows and Linux.  I got tired of both the hardware and software breaking down quickly.  Apple isn't perfect... my last Macbook Pro chugged along for over 6 years until the keyboard repeatedly failed, but that still beats all previous laptops I owned that had numerous problems unrelated to how I treated them."

The keys are beginning to stick.  The screen is beautiful, but gives me a terrible headache.  The memory pressure issue with the M1 is also a real problem in Safari, which locks up about every three weeks if you have a lot of windows open-- and it take a LONG time to force quit safely and recover lost work.  The laptop is also too big-- that extra inch or so of width really makes a difference.  The loss of practical functionality in iTunes is really disappointing, iMovie and Garage band have become much, MUCH harder to use in Big Sur as well, and Apple's insistence on trying to force me into using the kloud is both intensely irritating and very dangerous for my business, where confidentiality is absolutely critical.It is true that the processing speed for offline tasks is impressive-- my music projects do sound much better-- and photo and video editing is great.But the M1's speed is not enough of a reason for me to bond with this computer.  As the months have rolled by, honestly, I've come to kind of hate it.  I'm looking forward to refurbishing my old Macbook Air, and I'm thinking this may be the last Apple product that I buy, even though I can't think of a suitable alternative.I am a 64-year old professional health care provider who has been in IT since the early 1980s, and while it's true that I have generally been very unhappy with how gratuitously awful the end-user interface of most tech products have become over the last quarter century, there are some computers that I have actually liked-- my old Macbook Air was definitely one of them.  This is definitely not."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Incredibly Fast & Powerful,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 21, 2021",5.0,"I absolutely love my new MacBook.  When it arrived I answered a few questions, connected it to my WiFi and off I went.  It has been a buttery smooth experience.  Keyboards are one of those things that are dependent on user preferences, but for me it's the best feeling keyboard I have ever owned.  Many professional reviewers agree it's terrific. The multi-touch pad is brilliant, and now that I know the many different combinations of fingers and movements I zip around getting work done.  For example a two-finger swipe right goes back to the previous web page, no need to hit that back button.  It is also custom configurable to your touchpad needs. What I appreciate most is the total cost of ownership value.  I bought Final Cut Pro X when it came out 10 years ago yet there was no charge to get the latest version downloaded from the App Store. It does everything I need without an ongoing subscription fee like others have.  I still can't get used to how fast it works, it took me an hour to render a video on my old Mac but this MacBook did it in just a few minutes.  And it's cool and quiet! I'm using a huge 70"" 4K monitor as my secondary monitor.  Battery life is ridiculous.  I plug it in every 2 or 3 days depending on my workload, which is several hours per day.  I think the web camera is fine for me and many notebooks use this same 720p size.  I join one Zoom conference per week, so it doesn't really matter. The one thing I hope gets updated with the next release are the ports.  I'm using a hub because it only has two thunderbolt ports. I recommend this notebook to all my friends and family."

It has many new features that will be helpful for school and work. The laptop is affordable, portable, and has the new M1 chip. The way the laptop is affordable is because you will be able to pay for it monthly so you will not spend all your money at once. You will also be getting what you pay for with its latest features. It is also portable because it is light weight and slim. This will help you carry it anywhere you need to and will be very helpful if you go to college, since you will be carrying from class to class. Lastly, it has a new M1 processing chip. This M1 chip makes it better than any past MacBooks, it keeps you laptop running smooth and fast, it also gives you long battery life.

I still have 12+ year old Imac as and afraid to say to jinx myself it but love the big imac that replaced it for my office a few years ago.  IM sloppy and like to sit in bed and watch youtube while working or doing whatever I need to.  To the meat, these have both had quite few issues. Mine had the control key get stuck and by the grace of god and yt vids, I used sloppykeys or whatever it was after athourough cleaning to make it work.  My partner, I shut theres and apparently a piece of rice was near the trackpad and when we opend it the screen was broken, not cracked but no longer vicible.  Ive had so many macs develop issues. The biggest one they made was over 2k many years ago and had the known logic board failure.  I didnt know until after, my logic board died , even though faulty, they wouldnt cover past warranty.  Making a faulty product in america means anything after a certain time no longer counts even though it was they who made something that would fail.  I have 2 last gen macbooks both missing keys so external keybpoard only.Apple makes products with a lot of flaws. i think they were excellent back 10+ years ago but now I dread the company. i stopped buying iphones after mutiple died for various reasons, charger ports. etc. using sloppy cheap android now.  your identity should not revolve around corporations, were wasteful and gross.  Now Im down one macbook and not wanting to buy another with protection racket coverage but why pay more for a an m2 w pretty muc no difference or a 14"" for twice the price.A companies politics of greed and un-excellence makes me hate buying from them but to my not caring to re=learn (I have a chrome book to un-apple but dont like it) .

Screen is actually amazing, makes a huge different coming from even an IPS windows laptop. Fanless is truly fantastic, laptop stays cool with demanding tasks while sipping battery. I sat there for 5 hours doing some serious writing and safari browsing, and barely lost ~20%. I'd imagine you could get a couple days with casual/moderate use.This laptop solves all the problems of the previous Air's, it doesn't get super hot and the fans kick on obnoxiously loud. Performance is top notch, and the only real downfall is the lack luster webcam, but I'm not knocking off a star because every laptop has at least one compromise. This is a compelling package for the price, especially if you get more than 3 years out of it which is very doable. Overall was very impressed with this machine coming from a Ryzen 3500u Windows laptop.Edit: Be warned, buying from Amazon is a hassle when it comes to returns. With expensive products like this Macbook, you will need to jump through hoops just to get permission to return and the only option is a UPS pickup which is very inconvenient. Just a heads up, unless you want to end up with Amazon tech support for hours."

The screen has cracked twice. As we can see from the image, it cracks from the top middle where Apple put the camera. My son used the laptop a lot, but he did not mistreat his laptop. I generally do favor Apple products. Apple already repaired this once. I paid nothing for that repair. However, it has now failed twice for the same issue. I feel this is a serious engineering defect. I likely will take it to Apple so they can diagnose it. I don't particularly care if I get the laptop back or not at this point since I suspect it may break again within six months. Unfortunately I cannot recommend the Apple Macbook Air due to this defect. I do expect a laptop to last at least 2 or 3 years. Apple normally makes great products and I hold Apple in high esteem. This product unfortunately is not one of them. Not all of the Apple laptops will face this issue. But if you search the web you will find others who have experienced this same problem. I am hoping Apple stress tests newer versions of their laptops to address this issue in the future. Apple may need to modify the camera assembly or display assembly. Or relocate the camera to a different location like the corner of the display."

I've used them for many (almost 20) years but recently bought this computer in December and my sentiments about this brand has completely changed. How the mighty have fallen!I was always the biggest Apple supporter. I have purchased many as gifts for relatives as well as bought them for myself. From the Apple watches to the screens and desktops to the macbook pros, macbook airs and phones. I defended them against the Apple haters and always had their backs. I thought I was going to be Apple for life. I even own many shares of their stock, which I will be dumping soon because I see the writing on the wall. I could tell something was up with them as Apple continues to have great earnings reports but their stock doesn't move. It's the biggest slug of a stock. I now think I have stumbled upon the reason why.If you google the recent complaints about Apple you will see. Apple does not have the great customer service they once had. I was mistaken to think they did. They have also started cheaping out... big time. The result? Products that don't last. Couple that with customer service that could give a flying eff if you remain a customer of theirs and I'm sensing a recipe for disaster unfolding here... Selling all of my $AAPL stock ASAP stat.Warning, do not buy this computer! Apple's quality has gone wayyy downhill.The MacBook Air cords are absolutely horrendous! I am on my third Apple cord in less than 6 months. I brought the product to an Apple store and the employee denied that there was any problem with their cords and instead blamed me. He told me I must be doing something wrong. Nothing has changed about my usage of their products. I've always used them the same way and never had issues with my cords until the computer was really old. Think years and years. Not months. So you'd think if I was the problem like this guy tried to say I was, I'd be going through computer cords right and left, right? Well I haven't. And looking up my account would prove that. However, Apple doesn't care. They want to charge me for to replace their defective products anyway.Welcome to the new Apple where the customer is always WRONG.Then the guy doubled down and told me that he'd been working at the Apple store for 10 years and I'm the ONLY person who has ever had a problem with their cord. A simple google search has proved that to be completely false. Everybody complains about the quality of their cords. This must be huge business for them selling cords like this.So the employees gaslight you and will blame you if something goes wrong. If you want to sign on for that, good luck. I hope you never run into a problem and see what I'm talking about but you'll be fooling yourself because it will only a matter of time. I am DONE! I work too hard for my money and they aren't the only computer show on the road. Lucky for me I speak PC too.Thanks for nothing Apple! Good job burning that bridge. You just lost a loyal customer over $19. Hope it was worth the extra $$$$. It's not the money Apple. It's the principle. I won't do business with companies who treat me like that, period. Peace out!"

Two years, hours upon hours of my life and a false commitment to make it right. I’ve been a Mac user for decades.  No longer.

My existing system has an Apple monitor, wi-fi keyboard and mouse, and a WD 3 TB external drive.The two USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro are inadequate!  I also bought a new 27"" LG monitor because I couldn't figure out how to use the old monitor with the new computer.  The LG monitor has 4 USB-C ports on the back, so I assumed would give me enough connections for my devices.  WRONG!!!!!Only one of the LG ports is Lighting compatible, so I had to use it to connect and power the laptop.  I had to buy a USB-C to Displayport adapter, plus a Displayport to Firewire adapter to connect my external drive, but this wasn't supported over the monitor's USB-C ports, it had to be connected to the remaining Lightening port on the laptop.  This consumed all the easily accessible ports!Then I had to buy a USB-C to USB3 adapter to connect my camera and other devices to the computer.  All behind the monitor.  It's a royal pain!  I've got it working, but I'm unhappy with the cludge.  I don't understand why Apple put together such a capable laptop with so limited connection capabilities.  I'm going to be d*****g with this terrible configuration for years.On the positive side, their claims of faster processing are true.  I can put together a church video, then export it to a file in 1/2 the time as my old laptop.  Even the upload speeds to YouTube seem to be faster."

This is the first time I've bought one that has mainly made me angry.I quickly discovered that I couldn't plug it into my printer because it doesn't have a USB port, so I had to buy a USB-C to USB adapter: $19.I also can't charge it using any of the chargers around my house from my old MacBooks or my husband's MacBook, so in order to have an extra charger, I had to pay $49. When it arrived, I realized it didn't come with a cord. Another order; another $19.And Apple is no longer using MagSafe connectors, so if you accidentally hit the cord with your foot or whatever, the cord doesn't just pop out of the computer. Instead, it drags your computer with it. Yesterday, just a month after getting my expensive new computer, I dragged it to the floor and broke the screen. It'll cost me $500 to get it fixed, if I don't decide to throw it into a dumpster.I now officially hate Apple. What's especially annoying is that they've successfully addicted me to their products, and I know I'm not going to change brands at this point in my life, so I'm going to keep having to put up with this kind of crap from Apple, plus how they're always trying to invade my privacy and force me to use iCloud and how their software now tries to make way too many decisions for me.I'm writing this review on my old 2015 MacBook Air and, even though it's slower than the new MacBook and the display is smaller and not as nice, I'm wondering if I really want to fix my new MacBook."

I couldn’t go without a laptop for 2 weeks so decided to risk it.  After a couple yrs of being super careful the display became distorted after just a slight bump, and after the warranty period of course.  Used it hooked up to the TV only for about a year, but as that was difficult in itself (overheating, prevented sleep function, etc), had to change course.  Didn’t wanna pay $550 for a new display, so…… bought the M1 2020 MacBook Air instead. Seemed to be operating well until 8 months in, when I wasn’t even anywhere near it and the display went totally out.  Wouldn’t turn on after repeated powering down so called Apple.  They had me power on with that shift-control for 10 secs and it went on again. However, considering my experience with my last laptop took no chances and brought it in to Apple.They ran diagnostics and found that the ambient light sensor wasn’t working.  That’s what automatically dims and brightens the screen when going into dark or bright places, in case you, like I, didn’t really know what it did.  Had never dropped this or mishandled it in any way.Sent in my laptop for repair and it’s now been more than a week without and they’re still “diagnosing” it.  Luckily my old laptop is still semi-functional if I hook it up to my TV.  And I still had a few months left in the warranty.  But what if it didn’t and I didn’t have the old one still functional?Two times in a row MacBook Air with serious display issues in the last 5 yrs, with no accidental damage from me. Aside from this, has superior speed and processing power, doesn’t overheat, but still takes 20-30 sec to power up and the touchpad functionality and the feel of both it and the keyboard are terrible when compared to the 2012 I used to have.If you buy an Apple laptop now Apple care plus is almost mandatory.  Will have to seriously consider going back to Windows for my next laptop."
"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop M1 Chip, 13&#34; Retina Display, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage, Backlit Keyboard, FaceTime HD Camera, Touch ID. Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray","A Close to Perfect Laptop for College Students (Or Anyone, Really).","Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2021",5.0,"(Heads-up, this review will be lengthy, but I wanted to cover every aspect to make sure you make the right buying choice).The MacBook Air has always been known as a popular choice for college students over the years due to the lightweight, slim design and good battery life. One caveat that has always plagued the MacBook Air of year’s past was underwhelming performance due to underclocked, lower-powered processors (which were always reserved for the “Pro” line). That was why I always got a MacBook Pro in year’s past. This time around, when Apple announced the new M1 chip, I was curious, so I watched hours and hours of reviews and decided to pull the trigger on the new Air (the Air has the same chipset as the MacBook Pro, with the same GHz at 3.2, while saving $300). I am on a budget, but I also didn’t want to sacrifice performance, so I was a little nervous I was missing out by not getting the Pro, but thankfully I have not had to sacrifice a thing.I am a full-time digital design student, so my workflow can be demanding at times with running Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign, etc. I previously purchased a 2017 MacBook Pro and it was my daily driver until about mid-March when I made a grievous error and went out and purchased a Lenovo Yoga C940 with 16GB of Ram, Intel i7 Processor at a whopping price tag of $1500.00. Buyer’s remorse soon followed as the Yoga was plagued with overheating issues, thermal throttling and absolutely horrific battery life. The only thing that I liked was the speaker set-up and the 4K touch screen. Other than that, I was beyond disappointed. I sent it back, and went back to using my 2017 MacBook Pro, until I purchased this Air.So the pro’s:Fantastic battery life—I have a tough time killing the battery on this computer. It will easily last an entire day, and even longer if you aren’t totally hammering this thing with demanding apps like I do. It’s great to know you don’t have to always carry a charger with you everywhere (you can carry from class to class, the coffee shop and back home and it’ll still have battery to spare). A win in my book.Heat management and fanless design—I am super nit-picky about heat management and fan noise when it comes to laptops, which is why I always love the MacBooks and detest Windows (hence sending the Lenovo back).  The fact that this computer is fanless and manages to stay cool to the touch boggles my mind. I don’t have to worry about a computer than will get so hot that you can fry an egg on it, or annoying fans kicking on. I also like that I don’t have to worry about blocking any ventilation grills, since there is no fan. I can sit in bed with covers under this and not worry I’m blocking a fan exhaust.  Again, another win in my book.Slim design—at 2.8 pounds, and having a tapered design, you can throw this thing in a backpack and not feel like you’re lugging around a brick. I also liked the tapered design as it’s a little more ergonomic than my MacBook Pro that has some really sharp edges by the trackpad. It’s a nice change for someone that has to type up essays all of the time.Keyboard—gone are the butterfly mechanisms of MacBook’s past. One thing I really missed when I gave up my 2015 MacBook Pro was the keyboard! Thankfully with the new Air and Pro’s, you get the scissor switch mechanisms back, so my fingers don’t feel like they’re hitting bottom when typing for long periods of time.Trackpad—I love, love the force touch trackpad. I still believe Apple has one of the best trackpad designs of any laptop out there. Hands down. It’s smooth as butter.Performance—This is the little machine that could. It puts my 2017 Pro to shame. It also outperforms the Lenovo that was supposed to be top of the line, at a fraction of the cost. I can have multiple tabs in Safari open, Photoshop, Apple Music, Microsoft Word, and this doesn’t even break a sweat. I also like that I can do some light video editing on this. For most people—especially college students—this computer’s power should be more than sufficient. Keep in mind if you are a professional videographer or photographer, you might want to opt for the Pro as it does have a fan and can sustain heat management better in terms of thermal throttling. Again, that’s if you’re editing like multiple 4K videos on a daily basis, but for college students or the average Joe that may only need to do the occasional video project—no problem! This computer can handle it!Screen—It’s nice and bright, and the color accuracy is on point, which is important if you edit photos or videos in any capacity like I do.Speakers—I am a music junkie, and I have to constantly have music going when I’m working on school projects, and for such a thin and light laptop the speakers on this are actually pretty good. Good stereo separation and punchy. They could do with a little more bass, and when you max the volume it can get a little faded, but that’s to be expected for such small speaker drivers. I am more than pleased with them. They also work good for binge-watching shows on Netflix.The cons (there are few):The webcam—it’s a 720P webcam, and well, it looks like a 720P webcam. It’s a little grainy and washed out. It will do in a pinch, but you’d think in 2020 we’d get an upgrade on the webcam.The lack of ports—in true Apple fashion, the I/O is somewhat lacking. You have 2 thunderbolt 4 ports, of which you cannot plug in an external GPU, and are limited to one external monitor (this is a limit that Apple’s M1 system on a chip, not the thunderbolt ports, which I am sure will be resolved in future iterations). I would have liked to have seen at least one USB-A port for legacy things like flash drives, etc. But that’s just me being nit-picky.M1 chip running Intel apps—because Apple’s M1 chip runs on ARM and most apps are coded for Intel, there are many apps that have not been optimized to run the new Apple chip natively (like Adobe Creative Cloud). You might run into a few glitches and hick-ups while app developers are getting up to speed. So far, I haven’t really run into any issues, but there is that possibility. I am sure here soon it won’t be a problem. Again, it’s nit-picking.--To sum up: this MacBook Air is a winner. I would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, and I would absolutely buy it again. You get the performance and the portability, while saving some $ by not buying the Pro line. I am very happy with this computer and think I might just have come as close as I can to the perfect laptop for my needs.Happy shopping!"

Buyer beware!!!! I've been a Mac and Apple user exclusively for the last 15 years or so. I cannot express how bad this M1 mac is. I bought it for work (professional audio, recording, live audio, Protools etc.) and it literally failed at everything that I needed it to do.Once I got back from a 7 week run on the road with a musical act, I tried to return the computer to the store, but to no avail. It was past the 2 week return window. Apparently Apple does not stand by their product anymore. They wouldn't refund me or even exchange it for a different model (with Intel chip). So I spent $1600 on a new computer that literally failed at all the work tasks that I really needed it to do and there is no recourse. Not to mention that for $1600 you get 2 thunderbolt/usb-c ports. Because of this I ended up purchasing a high quality docking station ($280) and still some of the features that I was counting on like the AVB network protocol would not work on this M1 Mac (unless you buy 2, yes 2, Apple adaptors to use in tandem). Sounds like a rip off right? I've literally spent days and hours on the phone with support from Apple, Windows, Parallels, OWC, Kensington and at the end of the day the M1 mac just isn't compatible with so many things.I've been a staunch Apple user and fan for many years, but this experience might just bring me back to Microsoft.Please stay clear of these M1 macs and don't count on the Apple store to provide you with excellent service (unless you are about to hand them over a few thousand dollars for a new computer that underperforms).For $1600 + $300 (for docking station and case) I got a bunch of disappointment, stress, frustration. Literally the worst purchase I've ever made.Regarding the Apple Store where I made the purchase: They apparently are in the business of taking a customer's money, but not in the business of providing said customer with anything else except a bad product."

So this is a review of the product.  For many years, I have found Apple products to be overrated and overpriced.  That includes this product.  For example, as others have stated - no good ports (you need to buy all kinds of attachments), no touchscreen, etc.  And, of course, there are compatibility issues with anything not made by Apple.  But my biggest beef is that it is not reliable.  I recently downloaded Monterey - and am having all kinds of problems.  I find all these 5 star reviews hard to believe."

The first one lasted nearly 5 years and was a rock-solid laptop. The new m1 machines are garbage. Do some research on the internet. The screens break and Apple denies there is a problem.  We have had this one for about 8 months and the screen just broke a second time.  I've paid $200 for Apple care and $100 twice to replace a screen.  We did NOTHING to the screen. no signs of abuse, a bump, a scratch, NOTHING. just open one day and the screen is black and pixelated. The break is internal. When its not broken, its a great computer.  Just be ready to buy it several times over replacing the screen.mIf you are already a victim, there are law firms taking cases.  Apple ought to step up and just deal with the defect.  Forcing customers that have been loyal to the brand to join in a class action suit in order to deal with the know and ongoing problem is awful.  Too bad they are so big they just don't care."

About a month ago, I randomly opened my laptop to find colored lines across the screen. No damage to the phone as most my classes were remote and I was using my computer on my desk. It ended up going away on its own after shutting it down for 2 hours, but lines continue to reappear every few days or so then disappear after I let it rest. I looked it up online and it seems to be a hardware issue but I do not know how to fix this since I did not cause the problem. Never installed anything additional on my laptop besides google chrome and R software for research. Do not go through Amazon to purchase mac products."

This is unfortunate for a time that the majority of us are working at home or are reliant on FT for communication.2. It's important to be mindful, and as most techs will admit, this is easily apple's worst M chip--it will only get better!

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Lack of ports.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 29, 2021",1.0,"Apple makes an incredible product. But their contempt for the customer knows no end. This is especially exemplified by the reduction of ports to only two on the MacBook Aires and even some Powerbooks. And EVERYTHING is put into those two. The separate power port is gone. The separate video out port is gone. In some cases, even the audio out port is gone. All they leave you with is two USB ports which they expect you to use for everything. For a lot of people, like myself, multiple ports are needed for constant use. They are needed for external hard drives (especially for file backup where you don't want to use the Apple Cloud which is susceptible to NSA snooping), external DVD and CD burners, special printers that do NOT work with Bluetooth, special mice for people like myself with handicaps that make trackpads difficult, drawing pads, etc. etc. etc. And don't tell me to just get an external hub. I have tried them all and NONE of them provide proper power to external tools that need it. Plus they frequently get hotter than a firecracker. In summation, Apple needs to start giving consideration to the Customer's needs and not just to some fancy ""updated"" technology. Bluetooth does not work dependably and is a real pain most of the time and is not available for all external tools. We NEED physical ports. Please put them back on the MacBooks, especially the ""Aires"". And stop taking them off of the Mac Cubes. The last one I bought had no audio port causing extreme problems with my video production work. PLEASE APPLE, BRING BACK THE PORTS. Otherwise I may be forced, God forbid, to go back to Microsoft computers."

My entire life I was so excited to always purchase an Apple MacBook/MacBook Air because of the positive reviews. I tend to review most everything in the most positive light, but this is just horrible. I constantly come back to the laptop and it says ""Please report unexpected shutdown to Apple."" This has happened at least 8 times with no response from an Apple Technician. Then the camera quality for a 2020 Machine is something out of the 1990s. It's horrible, I look grainy and I bought this laptop for an MBA program. If you want to run many programs at once, even with upgrade RAM and Processor, you will hear what sounds like an airplane trying to take off CONSTANTLY. The. fan. does. not. shut. off. Sure it's portable, sure the ""build"" quality feels good in the hand. In terms of performance, spend the extra money and don't get this. I'm quite embarrassed I shelled out over $1k for this. Do as you wish, but this laptop is not worth the money and has pretty much ruined my desire to get any form of an Apple Laptop again."

The guy says the display is flimsy and subject to crack. I go online to see if he is telling the truth... found a LOT of hits of others complaining about how easily the screen cracks.I'm a big Apple fan but am disappointed and outraged that Apple would sell a product with such a design flaw and expect users to ""buy Apple Care"" so that they pay ""less when it breaks""... even under NORMAL use.Save your money, buy and older model or get an iPad which ironically can take a beating by a 12 year old gamer without fail!"

I brought this Mac book and have been satisfied with functionality and speed but I’m giving 1 star because apple really nickel and dimes us as customers. The usb c cable that comes with the laptop is not even close to being one of the best on the market. I attempted to use it to power my elgato game capture card and the card would not read. Kept saying I need a usb3.0 to work. So I then used the cable that came with my Samsung external hard drive and bang it work immediately. I spent a lot of money on this laptop just to receive a weak cable with it. The cable is literally only good for charging and light duty file transfer which I guess is ok for most people. But for me it was not. Apple already doesn’t give us headphones anymore and they don’t even have the decency to give us a very good cable. 1star because for this price I could have built a computer or brought a prebuilt one. Last apple laptop I will ever buy. O and the camera sucks and there are no setting to adjust it.

Rather because I was sent a computer that didn't know how to migrate data from one mac to the next, which is fully unacceptable. Every prompt to fix this issue adds more time I've had to invest in this problem and ultimately makes things worse. I've been at fixing this issue since Tuesday. It would be fine if the process hadn't bricked my old computer where, once I was running logic, can now barely open a pdf. I've been thinking of moving out of the mac eco system for some time now and this will certainly push me on my way out of it.

In 2015 Apple perfected the MacBook. Then, they ruined it.Everyone in 2015: It's great. A bit more battery life would be nice.Apple: We'll make it thinner, make the touchpad so big people hit it with their palms, remove the magnetic break-a-way power cable that everyone loves, replace all the ports with USB-C ports so people have to buy dongles, swap the keyboard for one that barely even functions, and hell (just to mess with everyone) let's lower the battery life.The 2020 does little to fix any of the issues. It's a crap product, but after Jobs died Tim Cook couldn't make changes because he'd basically be admitting he was wrong.

SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac."

Grainy zoom video.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2020",2.0,I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.

I'm an open minded technology user and tend to go with best of breed or technology that pushes the envelope of what is possible. I like well designed hardware that looks and feels good, and works well.I bought this one open box, that shouldn't matter at all, and it doesn't. It arrived from Amazon Warehouse Deals as ""like new"" condition with ""like new box"" and the unit had no scratches/scrapes on it and was missing 3 months of warranty-- I'm happy to have the remainder.The latest Macbook I had was the 12"" Macbook from several years back. It was quite nice but was too small for me. This one has continued to improve on the screen, battery life and CERTAINLY has improved on the performance front.The unit is thin, svelte, and HEAVY. I mean, it could be a solid block of metal and I would expect the same heft. It's solid. This is not a bad thing for a device that is this thin & small to add some durability to what could otherwise be a very delicate device.The keyboard is very solid with a nice clickety-click, I am not able to tell a difference from this keyboard to the generations that were rather ""controversial"" and I very much do appreciate the touch ID in the power button.Having two USB-C ports is very welcomed compared to my previous which had only one.When looking at the performance of the M1 chip and all previous models, especially the 12"" Macbook, and comparing to the prices those still sell for, it was a no brainer to go with this model. Even compared to the Macbook Pro M1, there is a very slight difference between the two and for a rather light user the cost here was really an incredible value.I love Windows for some things. I have Windows running on this unit as well with Parallels-- easy and simple-- do note you will need to download ARM Windows 10 media for this unit-- I was not able to find a way to migrate my previous VM from Intel based.  It runs very well here and with no issues. Very fast.One thing that didn't work great for me-- maybe it's me-- maybe it's Mac OS-- was plugging it in to a USB-C dock. I have a standard setup at home with 3 monitors, USB based external bose speakers, keyboard, mouse, and typically as I cycle through Chromebooks and Windows devices, I'm able to plug in and fairly easily extend / activate those monitors, use the peripherals and printer/etc. In this case I haven't had success getting this Mac to work with my USB-C based dock and accessories-- to be determined.The screen is beautiful, the hardware is unbelievably solid, the speed is amazing.  I also have a Surface Laptop that I love, but for the Mac variety, this is my perfect equivalent."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Great specs for an entry-level laptop.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2021",5.0,"I was looking to upgrade from my current dual core intel i7 Windows laptop and tablet. The 2020 MacBook Air M1 screen is sharp, the M1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses . This laptop is fan-less and gets very warm/hot only when constantly exporting very large 5Gb+ files - otherwise it runs cool to cold. I edit photos on this laptop and my editing software opens much faster and the edits occur very quickly. The 8Gb ram/256 Gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive. The Mac OS memory management allows 8Gb to be more than enough for my projects. The M1 cpu performance and battery life for the MacBook Air M1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 Windows laptop and tablet. My photo editing software runs faster and is more responsive than on my Windows devices. Also, the MacBook Air M1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my Windows devices. This laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the Pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options. I purchased this used base model used at a substantial savings over the list price which made it a fantastic value. I would suggest most users get the 512Gb or larger internal ssd so you won't need an external ssd for video/music storage. I currently use external ssd drives to store my large files so the small 256Gb ssd size in the base model was not an issue. The only possible drawbacks for the MacBook Air are there are only 2 usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the M1 cpu. I run Microsoft Office 365 on my MacBook Air. I notice that Office 365 takes a second or two longer to load but once loaded Office 365 runs as fast as it does on Windows.  I don't use this laptop for gaming, video editing, or to connect multiple monitors so I can't comment on those uses. I was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device. Don't get caught up in the hype that this base model can replace the MacBook Pro models for heavy work loads or professional use - it doesn't have the heat distribution (fans) to dissipate the heat to prevent thermal throttling under heavy computing or gaming. For most users, just use and enjoy your 2020 MacBook Air M1!!"

Really happy with the MacBook Air. Don't let the lack of a fan be off-putting. The only time it gets even remotely warm is when rendering a video in iMovie. Even then, it's by no means hot to the touch. This is probably the most fail proof laptop out right now and dare I say, ever. The lack of a fan eliminates the last mechanical part and means this laptop have no moving parts. The soldered in m.2 storage and committing to your RAM choice for the life of the laptop is my only complaint. So far I'm not finding 8gb of RAM to be an issue. Most of the programs for Mac OS are pretty well optimized for the M1 chip. So Everything feels to work pretty smoothly. The battery life is next level. Over all it's more powerful, cooler and the battery lasts longer than ever. If you have been wanting to get your first MacBook or have been batting around the idea of an upgrade. This would not be a bad choice."

The battery life is incredibly good I can constantly get over a day with moderate to high use and yet somehow still manages to be an incredibly light device. It has a good dac and plenty of volume making it a good choice for audio lovers, especially if you use open backs since it makes no noise, and if you don't use headphones the speakers can get very loud and sound really good for a laptop. It runs mac OS which can be hard to adapt too but it is alot less power intensive than windows so you rarely have to worry about overheating or battery in daily use. If you are a professional video or photo editor or run intensive task look towards a pro computer and for everyone else this is a great choice."

The New MacBook Air powered by the M1 chip is one of the most exciting devices recently released by Apple. Although it looks just like the previous models, the M1 chip delivers insanely great performance.Design and buildSince its inception, Macbook Air’s design and build were one of its core selling points, and the Macbook Air M1 is no exception. It has that Signature Aluminium body that you’ll see with the other Macbook Variants. The laptop not only looks premium but it definitely feels like your money’s worth. You can easily open this laptop with only one finger, this is possible because of the incredibly engineered hinge design done by apple. One of the things that the original Macbook air lacked for a while was a decent display, gone are the days of a 720p panel. And brought is a beautiful P3 Wide color gamut 2560*1440p panel, The overall viewing experience is awesome! The bezels are the same size as last year's model, which was kinda disappointing when compared to other laptops recently released, but it's not something that will ruin the overall viewing experience. The updated magic keyboard has better travel and also the gigantic mouse pad is always a blessing, I’m yet to find a trackpad on a laptop that I like better than the ones made by apple. The dual speaker grills on this laptop produce pretty decent sound, however, there is some slight distortion at high volumes.StorageStorage is also very important as a college student. As you're going to need some space to store all your documents, files, and Zoom Lectures. The MacBook Air comes with up to 2TB of SSD storage. This specific model I have only had 128GB of storage which honestly should be fine for most students, and if you don’t want to spend a lot of money you can always buy an external SSD or hard drive. This will cost you way less than what Apple offers.PortabilityAs a College student in 2021, because of Covid, it's been kinda different, (Very small pause)all of our classes nowadays are held on zoom or some other online platform. So if you wanna use this laptop outside of a typical campus setting, then portability starts to matter. The MacBook Air weighs in at 2.75 pounds and is 15.6mm thick. This laptop will easily fit in most backups without feeling a noticeable weight difference. This is important to a lot of students, especially if you have back-to-back classes keeping in mind the average textbook weighs just over 4.6 pounds. This Laptop also easily fits in most handbags for women who were wondering.Reliability and BatteryThe Apple MacBook Air has proven itself as one of the most reliable laptops for a student this past decade. The Macbook Air is going to be a more compelling laptop for the students this, because of its insanely reliable performance for its price, but let's talk about the chip that’s made all this possible.The biggest change this year is no doubt the M1 chip, the ARM-based chip is fast,  like stupid fast. Applications open up real quick and the performance is consistently reliable. Not only can it easily fly through day-to-day tasks like browsing the internet and typing research papers, but it can also handle intensive tasks such as 4K video editing, in fact, I managed to edit an entire 4K video on the M1 MacBook air and the performance & exporting times were very impressive. Anyway, that was sometimes impossible on the previous-gens of Macbook air. Now if you are considering this device for video editing then I would highly recommend the 16 Gig variant.The next best thing aside from its insane performance is the incredible battery life, I think this is the best battery life I have ever seen on a laptop of this form factor. The laptop lasted me multiple days of light usage with the usual workload being typing, browsing, and streaming content. I can pull a full day of heavy usage with tasks like editing photos and videos.ConclusionOverall there’s a quote that says, “Speed is irrelevant if you are going in the wrong direction”. (Mahatma Gandhi). The Macbook Air M1 has set a new benchmark for consistent performance and delivers insanely awesome battery life which makes the overall experience pretty fire. Its Portability, reliability, and speed not only make this a great investment for a student but also for anybody who’s always on the go, and I’m personally really excited for the direction that Apple is heading towards with their new M lineup of processers."

Easy to transition from my old 2104 MacBook Pro. I also bought an external HD which was cheaper than upgrading from old 256 to 512. My warning is about Office 2019. There was stuff on the web that 2016 would not work, needed 64bit, but while there seemed to be workarounds, I just upgraded and bought 2019. There is a scam site posing as Microsoft Office/setup that looks legit once on it, but you get an error message and phone number to resolve. After half an hour he explains that it is the firewall and can fix it by downloading one costing only hundreds of dollars. The url isn't Microsoft but rest looks like it. While I didn't fall for it, it is preying on the few who might. So thought I would mention it. The mac is good and worth upgrading especially if, as with mine, hardware faults are developing in old one."

So far it has been a pleasant experience and I like the stock software and layout. I haven't really had to purchase any additional apps to be able to do the things that I've become accustomed to on PCs, so there is a nice learning curve. I do have a couple of constructive criticisms, that are not specific to the MacBook Air, though. In the future, I'd like to see touchscreens included on their laptop models (being a former teacher of persons with autism, they really benefit from the additional input method). Also, the Retina display is awesome, but maybe in some of their higher priced laptops like the MacBook Pro they can start using OLEDs as model upgrades. Other than that I'm a fully satisfied Mac devotee now (though I still love my PCs)!"

I think I will stick with it.Update:  after trying this Mac for a year I gave up. As a lifelong Microsoft user I just could not make the switch and I bought an inexpensive PC which I use a lot more than I ever used the Mac.  The biggest hurdles were the hot buttons and incompatibility of spreadsheet and word documents. Nobody else seemed to be able to open them. The only way was to export to Excel or Word before sending them out and this resulted in a lot of versions of the same documents. Also the file manager was too hard to get used to send did not easily manage photos. I’m not changing the rating because lifelong Mac users would probably have the same problem in reverse.

I've ran heavy games and video editors and its done amazing! it's even beat some of my other $8,000 MacBooks! It's very light weight ( 2.8 pounds ) and is very thin but yet durable. It doesn't feel cheap like some laptops at this price point, It feels very premium with the metal body and soft keys and the retina display. The track pad is VERY large for the size of this laptop. I also love how it's fan-less so it never makes any noise which is another reason why it's good for students. ( video calls, etc. ) My one and only complaint is the camera quality. It looks nice if you have good lighting but if you're in bad lighting it looks like a potato filming. But if you can get passed that it's great. I also love how the keyboard is backlit, it helps a lot if you're in a dark environment. The screen is also very good, it's nice and bright and has amazing colors which is very good for photo editing! The package even came several days early and shipped very fast! Although the costumer service isn't very good. they didn't answer the questions I messages them about.

 I mostly use this computer for personal use and it is great at everyday tasks like browsing, doing homework, working, etc. I will it is not intended for gaming so if are looking a gaming laptop I would suggest a computer with an android or Microsoft processor. This will be your best bet. It is not very durable to potential drops which is why one must be very careful and handle it with care.As I discussed in the video, I highly recommend purchasing protective gear for your computer it might seem like an investment at first but it doesn’t have to be! Amazon has many deals under the “todays deals” section for any items you might need and things such as a keyboard cleaner or the trackpad protectors can be DIY’d with a bigger plastic protector.The learning curve for Apple is not that steep. It is very smart and sleek making it easy to carry anywhere.Hope this helped with your purchasing decision!"

I got the gold color one and it took me a while to decide between the silver & gold. But after receiving my gold Mac, I'm so happy I went with it. The color looks so much BETTER in person, it seems to have more of a rose gold color in person but if you take a picture of it, it looks gold.I use my Mac for some web searching, emails ( when I do so the battery does good) and if I'm doing some photo editing and downloads it dies faster. I spent all day on it and it does not get hot, so that's a plus. I don't feel like I have to give it a break.I got the standard memory and just got a hard drive to upload my photos on there ( if needed)Now the camera! it's terrible LOL but that doesn't bother me much because I won't be using or doing any zoom calls. But i wish apple would make it better since it's not a cheap lap top.I also came from not having a lap top, So far is perfect for me and what I use it for. I love that apple connects everything for you and it makes it that much easier to see emails, txt , calendar etc......I also love the vibrant color and sharpest of the screen."

Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Great laptop for a solid price,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2021",5.0,"I was able to get this Mac for around $800 in Nov. 2022. It arrived quickly and very well packed for shipping. I'm really enjoying it overall up to this point. It's definitely not a super powerful machine but for just normal everyday use it seems to be a very solid choice. Coming from a mid 2013 MacBook air its quite literally a night and day difference. Snappy response, amazing display in a very sleek form factor. If I had to complain about something, I would note that the keyboard has an extremely small travel making it a bit odd using experience at first but it's something you quickly overcome with just a couple hours of usage. Then, what I would consider the biggest downside is the lack of ports. A total of 2 USB-C ports and a headphone jack is all you get. Luckily there are countless USB-C hubs available for a decent price. I spent around $80 and got one that not only has all ports I could possibly need but also allows for a 2-monitor output. I would say for the price it's really hard to find much I don't like about it. When looking into a new Mac I was originally looking into the M2 Air but after reading up on them I heard a lot of complaints regarding overheating as well as slower overall peak speeds due to it using 1 single 8GB RAM stick opposed to the M1 using 2 4GB sticks allowing for the system to run more smoothly. When buying a base model, you're already going into it with a relatively small hard drive and low total RAM so when given the option I found it just made more sense to go with the M1 at the time of purchase. That decision was solidified when the M1 went on sale making it a nearly $500 price difference between the two models. To summarize, if you're looking for a reliable MacBook at a ""cheap"" price to have as an everyday mess around machine I 100% would say this is the one. It's nothing super powerful but it's far from sluggish. Great for normal use, streaming, browsing and minor editing etc. I have yet to find a situation in my regular use it couldn't handle, so for me it's exactly what I needed."

The ARM-based silicon chip is so amazing that I was able to forgive the laptop for its downsides, which are the 720p webcam, lack of SD card slot, and not being able to upgrade RAM or SSD. Despite these drawbacks, the battery life is insane and the machine is completely silent because no fan is needed since the laptop is so heat-efficient. You're also getting a powerful laptop that outperforms the vast majority of Windows laptops in the market. To top it off, you get a touchpad that puts other laptops to shame, a beautiful aluminum design, and build quality that will last. Well done Apple."

When Apple said it would cool passively, they weren’t lying. I’ve had 8-9 programs running simultaneously and it was obviously warmer, but nothing compared to any other laptop I’ve used. The fact that it’s dead silent when running is a nice perk as well.I like how they kept a lot of the tried and true design on the outside because I don’t think many people saw anything wrong with it to begin with.The screen has amazing clarity and, in true Apple fashion, all of my Apple devices connect seamlessly.Absolutely the best laptop one can buy right now."

The M1 MacBook Air really brings the quality for speedy and responsive user experience, great build quality and excellent audio! The air is incredibly quiet and the battery life is stellar! This is really the one to buy for this generation (M1) for cost and productivity. You still need a good USB hub to get more connections but this leaves the unit highly portable, it's a reasonable trade-off. For now we have not noted any memory system issues and we got the 512 GB hard drive model so that there would be more read-write space (a bigger hard drive makes a difference)."

I believe it was slightly faster in the kickstart by 2 or 3 seconds... yet back then I also paid about 1700 usd, my video card broke at some point back then and I was a bit upset that my only option was to replace the whole mother board, so I kept it broken and fixed it a couple of years later about about 320 usd and it worked decently for an extra couple of years for basic work...I then got an ASUS with 16GB plus 2GB just for video as I wanted it for video editing, but it has 2TB + 256 SSD so the computer is massive and heavy and it has a cheap unresponsive trackpad making it so inconvenient to travel or work at a coffeeshop. SO eventually I am back with Mac for editing my website, answering emails, and all the other trials and tribulations of work... It is so refreshing and made me realize how much I missed this system as well."

"Amazon.com: Customer reviews: Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop M1 Chip, 13&#34; Retina Display, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage, Backlit Keyboard, FaceTime HD Camera, Touch ID. Works with iPhone/iPad; Space Gray",Still competes with the new M2 model.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 17, 2022",5.0,"Picked up this model on sale for $799. If you can get it on sale, I'd recommend it even over the new M2 MacBook Air (if you're getting the base model) for those who want a capable machine that can handle day to day tasks and don't need all the bells and whistles of a Pro model.This has actually replaced a Windows machine that I was using for a long time for my daily workflow, and even with only 8 GB of memory compared to 16 on the Windows one, I find that this machine runs much better. It runs right out of the box without needing to spend a couple hours uninstalling bloat that comes standard with almost every Windows laptop that sucks up my RAM and CPU if I don't remove it. The only downside is that the 256 GB of SSD is a bit light, but since I mostly work off the cloud anyway, it's not a deal breaker. If you do need more, I would recommend buying a model with that space built in as you would need to get an external drive otherwise.Pros vs. M2 Air:- SSD is a bit faster (as it's two 128 GB modules running in parallel, while the new one is a single module) which also is a slight boost to longevity.- There is no notch on the display (I personally don't mind it, but if that's a sticking point for you this or the 13"" M2 Pro model would probably serve you better).- Slightly improved cooling system (neither Air model has an active cooling setup, but the integrated heat spreader on the M2 model is a fair bit smaller so it throttles itself a bit sooner), but not major if you don't plan on pushing too hard (and if you are, the M2/M1Pro/M1Max MBP is probably better suited for you anyway).- I find that I like the way the keyboard types a little more on the M1 model over the M2. It's definitely a matter of personal preference, but it feels a bit nicer to type on for me. Might be down to the fact that it uses the traditional wedge shape which gives a little bit of an angle to the keyboard, where the M2 MBA is more like the 2021 MBP shape.Cons vs. M2 Air:- No dedicated MagSafe charging port, meaning that you only get one available USB-C port to use when charging.- Overall system performance is a bit lower than the M2, but not really by a whole lot. If you're not planning on really stressing the system you won't notice.- Function keys are only half height, while the M2 has full height keys. Again, personal preference, but as someone with slightly larger hands who normally uses larger keyboards I prefer the full size keys.- Webcam is only 720p instead of 1080p on the M2. I don't use it that much, but if you do plan to be doing a lot of Zoom, FaceTime, etc. you may want to keep that in mind. It's still not bad, but the quality difference is something that you will notice.- Sound quality is a tad weaker in my opinion, but nothing major, and I usually use my AirPods or some other external speakers/headphones anyway.On the whole, it's still a great MacBook. Sure it's more expensive than plenty of Windows laptops, but the battery performance is solid, and even with only 8 GB of RAM (if you want more, go for a MacBook Pro instead), it's still overall a solid option for light to medium duty workloads due to how optimized the new Apple silicon is. On programs that take full advantage of it, the boost in performance is massive. Even with using Rosetta for older Intel-based programs, it's still quite fast. Compared to any Intel machine that came before it, it blows them out of the park with superior performance and battery life.If you can get it on sale, or a good refurbished one (in that case I recommend going directly to Apple), it's probably one of the best laptops on the market right now. For students and anyone looking for a Mac that's lightweight but capable, this is a solid choice."

Nothing even comes close to this. Spectacular battery life, incredible display, tactile keyboard and haptic track pad with all its' gestures and features which makes multitasking a wonderful experience. to top it all off, Big Sur (os) wraps it all up and makes your workflow the greatest pleasure. Only thing I would change is the camera. It is decent in a well lit environment but struggles in the dark. Putting a bigger sensor is a hardware limitation and I understand that. Having a display this thin comes with its' sacrifices. If I could give this laptop 10 stars I would. Don't hesitate on purchasing it, you won't regret it."

It's been 3 months now, smooth sailing.)CONS:I hate Apple so much for changing the USB port. You need to buy an adapter for any external drives with the standard old USB cord to work. I bought a beautiful cover for my MacBook but they didn't plan for the fact that many people would be plugging in a long adapter so I have to take the shell off.

So our family all pitches in and we get her the cheapest new MacBook you can buy.The MacBook Air with this M1 chip is super responsive, intuitive, fast, etc.There’s just one thing, it is completely overkill for her.All she does with it is check email, do her banking, and buy stuff from Amazon.Something tells me my daughter will be using it more than her…I own a MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro and saw no loss in speed when comparing general computer tasks.The MacBook Air is awesome and is perfect for students, business, video editing, design, and so much more, but should not be your first pick for grandmothers.5 stars for Apple fangirl grandmas."

This thing is an absolute beast, beats my old desktop easily.I can run Photoshop, Unreal, Lots of tabs in safari/firefox, and background processes; all no issues. Heck, I can even run a game with unreal engine going in the background. I've rarely noticed slowdowns, and when I have it's always been a software issue (typically memory leaks).I've abandoned windows... Haven't loaded it outside of a VM more than a few times this year. Don't hesitate to get this if you're looking for a new laptop.Update 01/11/21:Well, I had some issues but I love this thing enough I'm sticking with it.I believe a 3rd party USB hub killed the logic board and touch ID for it. I had to wait about a month to go theough the motions, especially with the time of year. Finally got my replacement back today and I'm really happy.Unreal Engine does not run well currently. It gets crashes and will freeze the computer. Everything else runs super smoothly and I never have issues. Really happy with the laptop.Initial post:Let me start this off by saying I was very skeptical. Lifelong Windows user, I've only had an iPod touch (2011) and very briefly an iPhone 6 (I think). I also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes.This thing has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The only drawback is that my current model only has 8GB RAM, but if you're conscious about what you have open it's not an issue; even with more intensive programs like Photoshop or Unreal Engine 4. Neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet, which as stated in the title, is really impressive.Gaming has been equally impressive. To be fair, I haven't thrown a next-gen game at it yet, but I threw games that I thought would be able to max it out. Nope, Civ 6, Borderlands 1, and Oxygen Not Included all ran at Ultra with FPS staying at steady 60+ in each game, even in more intensive portions of each game. I'm not saying it'll be able to play every game at ultra, but it's definitely been able to handle more than I though it would. It almost seems to be outperforming my desktop, which has an i7@3.4, and a 970ti. I think it might if I had the extra GPU core and 16gb ram, which is crazy for a laptop at this price.Overall, it's worth every penny. I could rant about all the small features that make the OS amazing as well, but you can find videos of that online/may already be familiar."
